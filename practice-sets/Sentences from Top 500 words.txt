Oh, that.
What have you done?
In a minute.
He is in the box.
Yes, that is true.
There is no one in that room behind you.
But never mind that.
It was full of people.
Her voice was low.
It has to be done.
Let him go free?
If only it were possible for me to see her once more.
The night was dark.
Are they on foot?
His will be done.
What a game.
Come quick.
How long would you keep me in town?
Is it certain?
Is that a fact?
There is your old bed.
Do you see any green in the white of my eye?
Go when you are ready, and sleep well.
But it must be done soon.
He stood up.
It is certain.
What has he done?
Oh, come now.
Yes, it did.
Oh, you are there.
When we got home the house was all dark and still.
Wonder if he has a name.
Of course he was right.
We are more strong together.
Clear my name.
But she is nothing to me now.
If only it were possible for me to see her once more.
is it come yet?
Oh, that is very simple.
She gave me her hand.
Yes, what is it?
Of course it is.
Well, there he stood.
Never mind me.
Is it possible?
She began to cry.
Yes, of course.
Go in there and drive them out.
He saw nothing.
Yes, she was back.
and so he decide he go back home.
This voice was that of my father.
It was very dark.
No, nothing at all.
Perhaps, after all, it is for the best.
It is a real bed.
My mind was soon made up.
Have you told them to bring the horse?
You must stay with me.
Oh, how can you sleep?
How is that done?
And then the game began all over again.
It was a dark night.
And what a voice she has.
Let us sit down.
In that town there is a street.
It is no use, said a voice.
Bring this with you.
Just let us go free.
The little boy lay in his bed.
You are free to do so.
Oh, tell me.
It might have done me good.
Well, sit down by me.
But how long ago?
Oh, very well, he said.
He must cover a lot of ground in one day.
She brought it home in less than an hour.
Perhaps he did.
Dont laugh.
No, nothing of the kind.
What brought you here?
Be quick, for the time is short.
Of course it might.
Sit down, said the old man.
Yes, it is true.
Oh, of course.
You can hear that, miss?
It was the same next week, and the same the week after.
Now we must wait.
Nothing she can eat?
Yes, and no.
Wait a minute.
My mind is made up.
He ran up to them.
Yes, but only for you and me.
His plan is very simple.
Each of us had done his work as well as he could.
Take good note of it.
That is a fact.
Again came the voice.
Then it is certain?
Oh, all right.
What age is he?
Nothing could have been better.
Did it all rest on me?
And what have you done to me?
Nothing is more simple.
Of course she will.
Wonder is it like that.
She could think of nothing more to say.
That is possible.
Are you strong?
It must be done.
I hear his voice in the house.
Yes, he said.
Oh, just listen.
He began to laugh.
If you fall dont wait to get up.
How long ago?
Oh, take those off.
Leave the rest to me.
Well, sit down.
Yes, there it is.
Did she stay long?
Oh, man.
You heard me say why, a minute ago.
It stood behind the door.
What has brought you here?
Perhaps you would like to read it.
They all fall to the ground.
Do you have my note?
Yes, said the old man.
The night was very dark.
Fly, my friend.
Well then, be quick.
Where can you wait for me?
Good to rest once in a way.
In her name, then, let it be done.
You know you must say yes.
Is that possible?
He had made up his mind.
She got up, and ran out of the room.
Yes, very well.
How was that possible?
Yes, she said.
What is power?
And he told you nothing?
He is among us.
Oh, do the best you can.
Then all was dark again.
Come back to us as soon as possible.
But wait a minute.
We must be quick.
Oh, nothing.
See what you have done.
The city was soon behind me.
Yes, once.
And here is the note.
And yet you are the better off?
He was here a minute ago.
Teach me what to do and how to use it.
This is a test.
He had, to be sure, done much.
Is he in bed?
Try to sleep.
Sit down, he said.
Free to do what?
Oh, take me with you.
But let us see your plan.
And you can do nothing until then?
Stay where you are.
It is his voice.
Of course they will.
Yes, go and find out.
Money is no object?
Nothing new under the sun.
Do you see that island?
It was a cold, dark night.
But what then must be done?
All was dark.
It is time for bed.
Nothing had come of it.
Yes, sit down.
He ran when he saw his father on the ground.
Oh, said he, that is life to me.
But that is nothing to us.
The night is so long, and yet so short.
They know nothing about it.
It was brought to me.
They call him a fine boy.
Then bring them to me, she said.
It is nothing.
It is all done.
Wonder what he does.
Never mind how he came here.
There, by the wheel.
He never said nothing.
Very well, wait a minute.
The whole day had been hot.
Oh, go on.
Help me sit up.
Keep clear of him.
Quick, friend, quick.
Yes, but what did she say?
Your voice is that of a young man.
How can a little dog laugh?
Look at that dark water.
Oh let me in.
You are in my power.
Yes, you are right.
It was a long time before she could sleep.
Yes, he said, all of it.
Who gave it to you?
Now if they had made it round like a wheel.
There was more to be done.
Yes, that is what will happen to you.
Which box do you mean?
Wait for me.
Why does the boat go so fast?
Why should my father fly?
It is possible.
It was a very dark night.
Well, what does that lead up to?
Who brought you up?
The snow is deep.
Yes, to be sure.
Then lead the way.
Well, miss?
People might know my voice and find me out.
You must stay.
Be back in a minute.
Sit down and let us talk it over.
Clear the table.
Oh, do as you like.
Well, what about my plan?
Yes, he did.
How was it done?
Wait and see.
You will fall.
The water ran dry.
He gave me this paper.
Better sit still.
Fine, very fine.
The island was a mile long.
Oh, this is too much.
That was well done.
Go back to bed.
What more is to be done?
They need a rest.
Come, let me show you my plan.
Oh, to be sure.
She was still game.
Here is our plan.
She heard and saw nothing.
Move on, my men, as quick as you like.
Yes, that was a picture book.
What can be done?
Can it be possible?
Why did you bring him here?
But never mind that.
His first cry was for his father.
Well, but where can he fly to?
Yes, my love?
You could see there was a story behind it.
Lead me to him.
Wait for me here, all of you.
Perhaps you will go and live with him too?
There is no possible way.
You can sleep here.
But what must be done?
There is nothing more to be said.
You knew it, and said nothing?
Go and rest.
Will you rest here a little?
She got her hand free.
Then he must be a wonder.
Oh, he is so kind.
We know from the record that he was on the water.
They would cry.
It was right in front of us.
It was a kind of language between us.
He knew nothing.
Oh, do you know?
The old man gave no answer.
What did the letter contain?
This made him wonder more and more.
Yes, go on.
A fine thing too.
Oh, is he on land or sea?
He must be in the same boat as us.
Yes, we know that.
We are free to act and think.
Nothing at all.
He left long ago.
Come, and we can rest together.
He will sleep an hour.
It was a record run.
What have they done with my work?
Oh, no.
It was cold and dark.
You must have a rest.
It was so very long ago.
Did she fall?
It is very clear.
Why, of course.
Let her wait.
That would be a fine thing.
Yes and no.
Clear the way.
The whole night the tree stood still.
Hold on a minute.
Play the game out.
It was so long ago.
Well, perhaps it was best for him.
Get to bed.
Money is power.
We brought them in.
Is my father in town?
You know nothing about it.
It must be done at once.
There is a lot of people.
Did he fall?
It was hot.
He brought it with him for us to see.
Wait a second.
Let me see your plan.
Oh, dont ask me.
You love a certain person.
Never mind that.
Do you talk in your sleep?
Bring it here.
Like these in shape and size?
Well yes, you are right.
All of this was possible.
What is done is done.
It must be a new moon out, she said.
Oh, if men only knew.
All that for nothing?
And yet you said he had money.
Half the town was there.
Decide if you are going back home.
It was a warm night.
At his side was a large green box.
Well, of course.
He must wait.
Behind every book is a man.
Nothing could be more simple.
You brought no one with you?
Quick, you must make it to me at once.
What have they done?
He has a good voice still.
Yes, all right.
Yes, tell them to bring me my horse.
Behind my bed.
Laugh, if you will.
It was done.
But they could see nothing.
If only they would be quick.
What kind of voice is it?
Yes, she could sing that.
Oh, but you were there?
You better stay here all night.
Answer me that, miss.
All right then, sit down.
Bring them here.
And sit in the dark?
Just go to sleep.
It is done.

They had much to talk about.
He is better than any of you.
Was he young or old?
Take notice.
The world is big enough.
She did it ever so much better than her mother.
You are right, my love.
Did he though?
What have you against me now?
We knew them both.
One or the other of you is for ever in the way.
You had better go.
Are they made to order?
Leave any for him?
Who told you so?
She knew at once.
It is a rock.
Let us pass.
He had enough of it.
She is the first person in this house.
But why must you leave me so soon?
Now listen to me.
Are you better?
Are you in love with her?
How many children did he leave?
He has money.
Why did it happen?
In short, take me.
That is enough.
Are you still cold?
That would be the best way.
What have you heard?
And so they knew that it was true.
But enough of this.
That must be true.
Now, listen.
The dog is always with him.
what could be better?
Where he was, no one knew.
Do you remember him?
He knew them.
Never heard of it before.
Is your man white or black?
Was there ever such a boy as this?
He will leave me.
Hold her hand.
From then on it was war between them.
Did you get any money?
you know better than that.
How soon will he be here?
Your watch is slow.
Who told you that?
What is love?
It is a fire.
That was the question.
Have you told her?
Where did they get the money from?
You will soon know.
Now, take this piece of paper in your hand.
Me to the North, and you to the South.
Do you remember me?
Can she sing?
What kind of a bird?
What will happen to us?
who told you you could?
She was a good girl.
It is cold.
On fire, on fire.
Does she go fast?
What could we do if he were to leave us.
What size do you want?
What will happen now?
Do you love me?
Pass this way, then.
Dont answer like that, my good girl.
Let me remember what he said.
Your true father?
We got her half way.
Do you own a dog?
Young man, you will go far.
They told me to.
It would have been more simple.
He is very simple.
Little girl, where have you been?
And so they began to talk.
What a state he was in.
Better cross here.
He got it this morning.
And you are still so young.
Why talk to me?
Her only thought was to reach his side.
About the usual time.
Look to the west.
And what does she want the money for?
Ten, did you say?
Why do they want to make her sing?
Never heard of him.
Why do you serve?
You will always love him?
We must try to find him, said the girl.
How does it feel?
This money was for her.
How did this happen?
It was the best thing that could happen to him.
Are you all ready?
You know me well enough.
Let us talk about you.
Have you heard from him often?
The rock was very small.
Pull it more to your side.
Look at the paper you hold in your hand.
We knew that before long the sun would set.
You may go, said the King.
We took our leave early, and left together.
Can it be true?
Half as many is too much.
It is the rule.
Has she any family?
There was no wind.
It can never happen.
Before you leave, tell us.
Is your family well?
Pull together.
Are you ready to play?
If you only knew.
Take a hold of it.
One other question, said he.
Remember that time?
Fire and water, earth and air.
You are in love with me?
It will interest you, said he.
We will talk about that.
Better late than never.
To know her is to love her.
They had heard all that before.
There are four hundred?
Let that pass.
It may turn out to be of more interest than you think.
You are a good girl.
We had a list.
This is my body.
Made me feel so young.
Then get ready at once.
He never heard.
How does this happen?
Let me also ask you a question.
She told me to ask you.
That was the rule, she said.
Are you here on leave?
What is there to talk about?
Let us stop at the next house and talk to the people.
Do you know that old lay?
Let me see him, said the young man.
How far from the body?
No more money?
Never heard of it.
When did this happen?
If they hear of this, will they let it pass?
She is much better.
Is it true?
The night was cold and still.
You can pass through the door.
So the question was, what to do?
Did they ever go back?
Well, young man?
Better write it here.
We must make the best of it.
Light my fire.
That is enough.
They all heard me.
They had several children.
Let us talk a little about my father.
And dont talk to me.
She is very plain.
What can happen?
Long and the short of it.
How could that happen?
You had better come to my house, said the man.
But listen to this, he said.
Had they been heard?
A better man than you.
When do you leave?
You must travel.
It is true.
And serve them right.
An example would be better.
Hold it up to the light.
Did you ever hear of such an idea?
Well, said the girl, let us go.
It has been there ever since.
But how simple it is.
This is simple.
Leave me out of the question.
We dont know enough.
That is very simple.
Let us leave them, she said.
You are right, young man.
You remember the place, my father?
There was no time to think of what might happen.
But one day you must feel it.
It was true.
Will you answer that question?
The family was at home.
They left in the morning.
Take the road to the South and you will soon reach it.
He put his hand over part of the map.
How do you feel now?
In an hour?
Listen to him.
Ask them to sing one more song.
Listen to this, will you?
But what did we ever get for it?
Had you heard?
How short his time.
Five young children.
We call it black.
I have no children to love me.
A young man?
you should know her better than me.
Where are you off to so early?
Do you remember?
They are still young.
Do you love her much?
Then what would happen?
This was true.
But she is very young.
Let me hear from you soon.
Why do we love?
Are we ready?
That is true.
It was cold.
Against what side?
What do you mean by that question?
Then you will know me better.
Well, are you ready?
She had very little notice from him.
Leave off that.
Lay your hand on this book and say it.
You are cold.
And how did he make his money?
That is enough for me.
In an hour it will be at the door.
She was only a little girl.
You may leave the room.
He said, the work is now complete.
But let that pass.
It was true to life.
Answer me this one question.
What does he feel?
No, he is a man about my size.
She must be told.
Long live the king.
He never told us what it was she said.
It would be better if you went to the war.
This will pass in no time.
The King Went to him.
You have an hour.
They had said little, though they had been there a long time.
What a question.
Take good care of the little girl.
They knew it.
We are ready.
Have you heard?
But listen to me.
And then he told all he knew.
It was all she could do to hold in.
Are you ready?
Then he saw through the whole thing.
She told me all about it.
It is a young girl.
Keep in step.
No less, no more.
Put down three and carry five.
Ten will be early enough.
She was so young, too.
They can have all our half of the house.
So do you, my love.
The night was cold.
Have you a family?
Which king?
You were told.
No, my love.
How do you feel?
But he never heard me.
Much of it was true.
We had better go in.
Do you want any money?
Half a mile?
You saw the person?
Is that true?
You are on a ship?
Is the wind north or south?
When they told us, she was well out to sea.
Let this man pass.
He had my love.
you must step out.
And will you direct us?
She knew what was good for children.
Every word you said was heard.
Does he love you?
Then she told me to try for the next one.
That may be true.
A house is on fire?
Who was it told me his name?
He said, get him out of the road.
We serve them.
You are better than that.
Listen to them, he said.
It was a round table.
An hour and a half.
Listen to me.
So we came down this road.
You love him?
And that is the whole point.
She is fast?
Did you tell him your whole story?
We were up early.
And why do you serve?
Can you sing?
You have your whole life before you, she said.
You must leave that to me.
Feel better then.
Try it on the dog first.
And you can sing?
Read them, said the King.
As soon as you left, it began.
And you will always love him?
If you know it, that is enough.

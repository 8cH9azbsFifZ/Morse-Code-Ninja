the fact of the matter is that ^
it should come as no surprise that ^
for the second year in a row ^
we want to hear what you think ^
this is not the first time that ^
it was only a matter of time ^
nothing could be further from the truth ^
take a look at some of the ^
the rock and roll hall of fame ^
from the point of view of the ^
there are a lot of people who ^

who was not involved in the study ^
it is important to note that the ^

it was the right thing to do ^
on the other side of the world ^
it would be a good idea to ^
to make the world a better place ^
the wrong place at the wrong time ^

what does this have to do with ^
in the days leading up to the ^
i dont know about you but i ^
hours a day seven days a week ^
the first of its kind in the ^
the good the bad and the ugly ^
i think its fair to say that ^
its only a matter of time before ^
in the early hours of the morning ^
who did not want to be named ^
between a rock and a hard place ^
be taken with a grain of salt ^
one of the best players in the ^
in the first round of the playoffs ^
i think its safe to say that ^
according to a person familiar with the ^
up in the middle of the night ^
these are just a few of the ^
as far as the eye can see ^
theres going to be a lot of ^
this is due to the fact that ^
for those of you who dont know ^
thank you for taking the time to ^
there is no reason to believe that ^
want to get a head start on ^
the next president of the united states ^
it remains to be seen whether the ^

for the first time in his career ^
there is no doubt in my mind ^
according to a new report from the ^

the last thing you want to do ^
the straw that broke the camels back ^
in the first quarter of this year ^

it took me a long time to ^
on the other end of the spectrum ^
well just have to wait and see ^
for the better part of a decade ^
to go back to the drawing board ^
a picture is worth a thousand words ^
the same thing over and over again ^
none of this is to say that ^
the first thing that comes to mind ^
help us be the change we wish ^
it doesnt have to be this way ^
to get to the bottom of this ^
this is not to say that the ^
as far as i can tell the ^
our thoughts and prayers are with the ^
what can only be described as a ^
so you dont have to worry about ^
as you can see in the video ^
the public has a right to know ^
if it aint broke dont fix it ^
as good a time as any to ^
for the first time in more than ^

are two sides of the same coin ^
i find it hard to believe that ^
is not for the faint of heart ^
who did not wish to be named ^
the best thing that ever happened to ^
or whatever you want to call it ^
for the first time in my life ^
the first three months of the year ^
work and no play makes jack a ^

depending on how you look at it ^
we are in the midst of a ^

there is no evidence to suggest that ^
would like to take this opportunity to ^
i dont know whats going to happen ^
a lot of it has to do ^
is in the best interest of the ^
to take matters into their own hands ^
let me know if you have any ^
out of the corner of my eye ^
to take a closer look at the ^
but that doesnt change the fact that ^
a good thing or a bad thing ^
who asked not to be named said ^
if you build it they will come ^
this is the kind of thing that ^
the best thing you can do is ^
i have come to the conclusion that ^
there is something to be said for ^
it should also be noted that the ^
went on to become one of the ^
if you want to learn more about ^
it will be very interesting to see ^
compared to the same period last year ^
there has been a lot of talk ^
get from point a to point b ^
some of the biggest names in the ^

let the cat out of the bag ^
world war i and world war ii ^
to give you an idea of how ^
but dont take my word for it ^
is considered by many to be the ^
a solution in search of a problem ^
in the us and around the world ^
over the course of the next few ^
what does it mean to be a ^
for the second week in a row ^
what i can tell you is that ^
the most powerful man in the world ^
to make it as easy as possible ^
a lot of work to be done ^
to make it easier for people to ^
a get out of jail free card ^
the amount of time it takes to ^
want to thank you for being with ^
i want to make it clear that ^
beyond a shadow of a doubt that ^
the more things change the more they ^
youre not going to be able to ^
once you get the hang of it ^
the world would be a better place ^
if for no other reason than to ^
about a year and a half ago ^
at some point in the near future ^
in such a short period of time ^
need to do a better job of ^
out of sight and out of mind ^
to spend more time with his family ^
were it not for the fact that ^
had no idea what was going on ^
were not going to be able to ^
what do you want me to do ^
is free and open to the public ^
on the final day of the season ^
on both the left and the right ^
to draw a line in the sand ^
to do it in a way that ^
doing the same thing over and over ^
on the right hand side of the ^
to get the most out of the ^
all good things must come to an ^
there are a number of ways to ^
when was the last time you saw ^
i cant remember the last time i ^
is without a doubt one of the ^
will go down as one of the ^
what we do know is that the ^
i dont know the answer to that ^
theres nothing you can do about it ^
the reason for this is that the ^
taken on a life of its own ^
i had no idea what i was ^
to come up with a way to ^
this is one of the reasons why ^
there was no way i was going ^
we will do everything we can to ^
as well as a number of other ^
and dont even get me started on ^
took on a life of its own ^
how did you come up with the ^
in the first half of the year ^
take a step back and look at ^
and the list goes on and on ^
since the end of world war ii ^
at the top of the list of ^
not that theres anything wrong with that ^
in the months and years to come ^
i think its going to be a ^
it would be nice to have a ^
there can be no doubt that the ^
we have to find a way to ^

the last thing i want to do ^
the aim of this study was to ^
once upon a time there was a ^

lets get this out of the way ^
there is more than one way to ^
it is with a heavy heart that ^
do as i say not as i ^
in the weeks leading up to the ^
the best thing to do is to ^
you cant always get what you want ^
theres never been a better time to ^
we are not in a position to ^

I did not think it was possible. ^
In the middle of the night she left. ^
I might not be able to come over. ^
But I think that is wrong. ^
It is one of the things that matter. ^
It would be a surprise. ^
In the sense that it is true. ^
She is a member of the club. ^
I know that a lot of people agree. ^
He woke up in the middle of a dream. ^
In the process of learning he found it to be true. ^
It has to do with respect. ^
You will be able to see it soon. ^
Over the course of a year things changed. ^
And you do not understand. ^
He is known as one of the best. ^
I do not know what to say. ^
These are some of the most common questions. ^
I do not think he knows. ^
At a time when it mattered. ^
Over the course of the week things improved. ^
The grass is greener on the other side of the road. ^
The fact that they arrived early was surprising. ^
To make sure that everything is okay check again. ^
The only way to solve this is together. ^
I did not know that. ^
He read it in the New York Times. ^
In the context of history he was right. ^
The New York Times published an article. ^
In terms of the law she was right. ^
I do not think it is right. ^
On both sides of the river. ^
They do not know that secret. ^
We need to deal with the problem. ^
In the direction of home you will find it. ^
The fact that he lied was disappointing. ^
It was going to be a surprise. ^
It is going to take a while. ^
They were going to call us. ^
He did not want to go. ^
At the center of the city you will find it. ^
At the turn of the century things changed. ^
Do you think it will rain? ^
She is the head of the department. ^
There are a lot of stars. ^
There are a lot of stars in the sky. ^
The nature of the problem is complex. ^
He said that there is no evidence. ^
I was going to call. ^
Everyone with the exception of Joe arrived on time. ^
I do not really understand. ^
We left it in the hands of fate. ^
It is the first time since January we had been there. ^
He gave the book to one of his friends. ^
In front of me stood a house. ^
The size of the room surprised her. ^
She is the author of a novel. ^
She had to be on the train by seven. ^
I want to be happy. ^
One of the most important things. ^
The majority of the people agreed. ^
It used to be different. ^
It is good to see you again. ^
In the middle of the night I awoke. ^
I did not want to leave. ^
It is difficult to say. ^
I see him from time to time. ^
He waited on the other side. ^
It is going to be sunny. ^
I will be able to do it tomorrow. ^
She shows a great deal of courage. ^
She stood on the side of justice. ^
They do not have enough time. ^
It is known all over the world. ^
They are more likely to succeed. ^
The rock was the size of a small car. ^
In one of the rooms is a thick book. ^
Tens of thousands of people attended. ^
As a matter of fact I was there. ^
It was going to rain. ^
We walked all the way to the park. ^
He does not have to agree. ^
She worked as part of a team. ^
It has nothing to do with you. ^
As a result of the test we passed. ^
That does not mean it is impossible. ^
I just wanted to say thanks. ^
It is a result of the hard work. ^
He did not know her name. ^
I think it was him. ^
What do you do for fun? ^
She needs to take care of her plants. ^
We saw them in front of a crowd. ^
She does not know why. ^
Despite the fact that it rained we went anyway. ^
The best way to learn is by doing. ^
He visited the United States in summer. ^
People are going to talk. ^
I do not know her. ^
The president of the club spoke. ^
In the Middle East cultures blend. ^
Because I do not agree I will not go. ^
I just want to help. ^
The table stood in the center of the room. ^
This is going to be fun. ^
It was in front of her house. ^
I feel that this is a great opportunity. ^
I do not have the book. ^
He painted both sides of the fence. ^
This is one of the best. ^
But I did not know. ^
It is one of the biggest challenges. ^
The president of the United States spoke. ^
She was one of the first to arrive. ^
What do you want to do today? ^
What does it have to do with the case? ^
There were cookies and a lot of candy. ^
It is a bit of a challenge. ^
And we do not agree. ^
If they do not agree leave. ^
I hoped that it would be sunny. ^
There has been a misunderstanding. ^
In the White House decisions are made. ^
We need to get rid of the old furniture. ^
This is not a good idea. ^
It was the first time I saw snow. ^
He played the part of the hero. ^
He parked on the side of the road. ^
Never underestimate the power of the mind. ^
And I think the plan will work. ^
It turned out to be a great day. ^
She is visiting from the United States. ^
What do you think about this? ^
If you look at the sky you will see stars. ^
To be part of the group is exciting. ^
And the fact that it is true. ^
You are going to do great. ^
The key was at the bottom of the box. ^
The use of the internet has grown. ^
This is the first time I have tried this. ^
It is two and a half hours away. ^
I do not like that. ^
In the way of progress it is good for the nation. ^
I will be gone for a couple of days. ^
To be one of the team is his dream. ^
In the case of rain come again tomorrow. ^
When we come back we will talk. ^
She did not have the key. ^
It is at the heart of the matter. ^
We found her in the wake of the storm. ^
Walk to the end of the road. ^
In the case of the missing cat all clues matter. ^
If you do not mind come tonight. ^
It was the beginning of the adventure. ^
We talked in the living room. ^
We did not have enough money. ^
And I did not see him. ^
Do you think you can help? ^
He moved from the United States to Canada. ^
But I think it is good. ^
He is one of the best. ^
She came home as part of the plan. ^
I need to talk to you. ^
Find it on the back of the photo. ^
I really do not care. ^
It was a mistake on the part of the team. ^
It is important to remember. ^
By the end of the day we will know. ^
He does not know where it is. ^
In addition to the cost we have to give our time. ^
We have been able to improve. ^
He spent a lot of money. ^
It is part of the plan. ^
In the absence of light it was dark. ^
He is more likely to be late. ^
I saw her for the first time today. ^
I had a chance to speak. ^
The vast majority of people agree. ^
We are on the way to the park. ^
I do not want to go there. ^
At the beginning of the year he went home. ^
If you have a moment let us talk. ^
I hope that you do not mind. ^
I believe that one of the keys is missing. ^
It might be one of the best. ^
I do not think so. ^
The most important thing is to be kind. ^
They do not know the answer. ^
I want to go back to school. ^
Im trying to figure out the problem. ^
She was one of the best students. ^
I would like to help. ^
I do not think I can. ^
And the United States is large. ^
Thank you so much for your help. ^
And I think that is right. ^
A few years ago things were different. ^
It is at the bottom of the page. ^
Take a look at this picture. ^
You do not want to miss this. ^
There are so many books to read. ^
It would have been easier. ^
And there was a cat. ^
I did not have enough time. ^
He felt a tap on the back of his neck. ^
This is the first time in years I have been here. ^
I want to talk about your grades. ^
I was able to learn. ^
On the one hand it seems easy. ^
And the rest of the day was free. ^
I do not believe that is true. ^
And I can not believe it. ^
We need to talk about the plan. ^
He waited in the front of the line. ^
It had nothing to do with me. ^
Do you want to join us? ^
You do not need to bring anything. ^
We arrived at the same time. ^
Because of the fact that it is true. ^
And I think we should go. ^
It is sad that we do not agree. ^
The United States has a large population. ^
I do not care about it. ^
It does not matter now. ^
They are going to the store. ^
The United States is a large country. ^
They are not going to come over here. ^
I believe that there is a solution. ^
They are going to be late. ^
She sat at the edge of the bed. ^
She did not want to leave. ^
Just a little bit of salt is enough. ^
But I do not care. ^
I heard that he did not come over today. ^
Do you think the team will win? ^
A large number of books were sold. ^
The two of them left together. ^
President of the United States. ^
To the extent that I know it is true. ^
They offer a wide range of services. ^
The start of the race was exciting. ^
What should I to do with it? ^
I do not know what to say. ^
I forgot the name of the movie. ^
I think that the idea is good. ^
She knows a lot of things. ^
This law is for the United States. ^
The shop is in the middle of the street. ^
You are going to be able to do it. ^
They have a lot of ideas. ^
She does not want to talk. ^
It seemed as if it were magic. ^
He read it in the New York Times. ^
At the end of the day we all go home. ^
It would have to be done by today. ^
Climb to the top of the hill. ^
It was not a mistake. ^
They do not want to go. ^
I thought it was funny. ^
In a lot of ways she was right. ^
I think it is time. ^
The rest of the world is different. ^
He is at the top of his class. ^
It has nothing to do with you. ^
Use it as a way to learn. ^
To take advantage of the offer call now. ^
They do not have a choice. ^
He is not going to come home. ^
Let me ask you something. ^
It has to be perfect. ^
You do not have the time. ^
A lot of people enjoy the show. ^
We do not want to go. ^
Please do not go away. ^
As far as I know it is true. ^
We must find a way to solve this. ^
The flag flew at the top of the pole. ^
It was the first time. ^
You have to do your homework. ^
She would be able to help you. ^
How do you know that? ^
I do not even know him. ^
I know what to do. ^
And I do not agree. ^
In the same way he smiled. ^
I would like to see the menu. ^
As long as the sun shines we will go. ^
I thought that it was a good idea. ^
He studied at the University of Texas. ^
On the other hand it is hard. ^
It takes a lot of time. ^
I do not want to go. ^
We do not know where it is. ^
The label was on the back of the bottle. ^
It was supposed to be a secret. ^
You do not have to go. ^
I do not understand you. ^
 I loved to play when I was a child. ^
I do not think you understand. ^
In the course of a day they made it home. ^
You have to be home by ten. ^
The rest of us stayed home. ^
What do you want for dinner? ^
With the help of his friends he finished the project. ^
I think we have a problem. ^
As a matter of fact yes. ^
It has been more than a year. ^
I do not want to be late. ^
Try to come up with a plan. ^
Take time to look at the stars. ^
It was as if she knew. ^
It was done at the expense of others. ^
Move out of the way please. ^
I read a lot of the time. ^
I do not remember the way. ^
As far as the eye can see. ^
He wants to be in the play. ^
It is time to take a break. ^
They do not think it matters. ^
There was a lot of noise. ^
I have to say it is good. ^
We are going to have fun. ^
You do not know her. ^
We have it in a variety of colors. ^
It is one of the most beautiful places. ^
And I think it is great. ^
He smiled in the face of danger. ^
This is one of the best days. ^
I do not think we should go. ^
I did not know what to say. ^
The United States and Canada are neighbors. ^
In New York City life buzzes. ^
And they do not know. ^
I am surprised by the fact that it is true. ^
She sat on the edge of the bed. ^
This is going to be the best day. ^
I do not know how to swim. ^
He was on the verge of crying. ^
You are going to have to decide. ^
The store is at the end of the street. ^
The results of the test came in today. ^
All of a sudden it started raining. ^
It turned out to be a mistake. ^
I want you to listen. ^
She knows the subject as well as the teacher. ^
To be able to read is important. ^
These are some of the reasons. ^
In the face of danger she was fearless. ^
It can be found in the history of art. ^
He walked up and down the hallway. ^
I do not want to go. ^
It seems to me that is right. ^
He is smart as well as a good friend. ^
She did not want to go. ^
He is a part of the team. ^
This is one of my favorite songs. ^
It is not going to be easy. ^
It is one of the great wonders. ^
He read the note over and over again. ^
In the center of town was the store. ^
He is one of the people who helped. ^
When it comes to math she is the best. ^
It is cold to the point where I need a coat. ^
They did not have to go. ^
In front of the mirror is a book. ^
Do you have any questions? ^
You do not have to go. ^
How do we get to the park? ^
There will be a meeting tomorrow. ^
Im here for the rest of the week. ^
In front of him stood a house. ^
Thank you very much for your help. ^
The extent to which it will affect us is unknown. ^
He was going to call her. ^
I do not know how to swim. ^
I just do not know. ^
And one of the best to see is here. ^
We do not know if it is true. ^
They moved to the United States. ^
We were going to eat out. ^
Canada shares a border with the United States. ^
The fact that the sun was shining made her happy. ^
The boat floated on the surface of the water. ^
Would you like to join us? ^
They ran as if they were chased. ^
We are going to the movies. ^
That I do not know. ^
In an effort to help she got job. ^
In the first place why? ^
Come up with a plan. ^
Thank you for being with us. ^
Do you want to be a doctor? ^
We do not think there is a chance. ^
If we do not hurry we will be late. ^
At the age of twenty he left home. ^
Hundreds of thousands of people attended. ^
I have known him for a long time. ^
It was one of those days. ^
In the name of love he bought a house. ^
On the edge of the forest you will find it. ^
I eat out once in a while. ^
The president spoke at the White House. ^
You do not need to hurry. ^
It is clear that the United States is influential. ^
You have the right to remain silent. ^
The first time I saw snow I was amazed. ^
It is the talk of the nation. ^
In the midst of chaos he left for home. ^
You should be able to find it. ^
And I want to help. ^
He did not have the answer. ^
He is got a lot of friends. ^
As long as you are happy stay here. ^
We are going to have a party. ^
We do not have any time left. ^
Most of the time it works. ^
In the back of the car was a book. ^
She was going to call later. ^
On the basis of evidence she was right. ^
One of the things I love is music. ^
Let us go back to the beginning. ^
You need to get out of the house. ^
It is important for all of us. ^
It does not have to be hard. ^
Are we going to leave? ^
I did not know what was going on. ^
You know what I mean. ^
She knew that there was a problem. ^
But he did not go. ^
Fans are all over the country. ^
At the time of the accident we saw her. ^
I do not even know him. ^
The book covers the history of the war. ^
He woke up late due to the fact that his alarm did not go off. ^
Do you want me to help? ^
What do you see when you look at the sky? ^
It can be used to clean books. ^
Do you think that is fair? ^
In the United States it is common. ^
Take a look at the menu. ^
This is the way to the park. ^
In a way that works for her. ^
What are you doing tonight? ^
In the form of a letter she said goodbye. ^
He left a couple of years ago. ^
That is one of the reasons I left. ^
They do not think the plan will work. ^
But you do not understand. ^
The cat sat on top of the fridge. ^
In the long run it matters. ^
It did not seem to matter. ^
In an attempt to improve she went to school. ^
For the most part it was a good day. ^
I do not see the problem. ^
What do you mean by that? ^
She came in with a lot of bags. ^
He did not have a choice to go. ^
He was not going to give up. ^
We do not think that is right. ^
For the sake of peace let us agree. ^
At the end of a long day she relaxed. ^
In the number of days. ^
It has been a year and a half since we met. ^
It was the time of the year for snow. ^
By the end of the day it will be gone. ^
It was time to go. ^
He acted as if he were king. ^
But I can not do it. ^
I will tell you the rest of the story later. ^
Let me tell you a story. ^
I can not believe it. ^
If you want to join us come back later today. ^
It is going to be a long day. ^
She had a lot of fun. ^
The role of the teacher is very important. ^
Are you going to eat that? ^
He wants to get out of the house. ^
We do not have the answer. ^
He has been gone for more than a week. ^
He lives on the other side of the city. ^
And some of the people left. ^
In and out of love. ^
Thank you very much for coming. ^
Why dont you come over? ^
Add a little bit more sugar. ^
I will write it down so I do not forget. ^
But at the same time I understand. ^
By the time the sun sets they be gone. ^
I can tell you a story. ^
If you can not come tell me now. ^
We plan to go to the beach. ^
He is one of the few experts in this field. ^
But it was not enough. ^
I think this is enough. ^
The park is in the heart of the city. ^
In the case of the missing cat all clues matter. ^
In front of me stood a house. ^
How do we get to the park? ^
In the long run it matters. ^
A large number of books were sold. ^
I want to be happy. ^
The flag flew at the top of the pole. ^
On the basis of evidence she was right. ^
She does not want to talk. ^
She needs to take care of her plants. ^

I see him from time to time. ^
As far as I know it is true. ^
I did not know what to say. ^
She sat on the edge of the bed. ^
As a result of the test we passed. ^
She does not know why. ^

She is a member of the club. ^
He gave the book to one of his friends. ^
Would you like to join us? ^
I will write it down so I do not forget. ^

In a way that works for her. ^
But I think it is good. ^
I think we have a problem. ^
A few years ago things were different. ^
There are a lot of stars in the sky. ^
He moved from the United States to Canada. ^
I read a lot of the time. ^
By the time the sun sets they be gone. ^
Most of the time it works. ^
He played the part of the hero. ^
He is not going to come home. ^
She was one of the first to arrive. ^
I hope that you do not mind. ^
In an attempt to improve she went to school. ^
If they do not agree leave. ^
Do you think that is fair? ^
The rest of us stayed home. ^
If we do not hurry we will be late. ^
Do you want to join us? ^
It is two and a half hours away. ^
I forgot the name of the movie. ^
She had to be on the train by seven. ^
You do not want to miss this. ^
It is going to take a while. ^
I do not really understand. ^
He read it in the New York Times. ^
They were going to call us. ^
It is one of the things that matter. ^
Thank you for being with us. ^
I thought that it was a good idea. ^
Let me ask you something. ^
He is one of the people who helped. ^
He read the note over and over again. ^
On the other hand it is hard. ^
Thank you so much for your help. ^
We found her in the wake of the storm. ^
The cat sat on top of the fridge. ^
It is the first time since January we had been there. ^
It might be one of the best. ^
Are you going to eat that? ^
He waited on the other side. ^
This is not a good idea. ^
They are more likely to succeed. ^
I did not want to leave. ^
The rock was the size of a small car. ^
When it comes to math she is the best. ^

In the face of danger she was fearless. ^
We left it in the hands of fate. ^
It has been a year and a half since we met. ^
I do not want to go. ^
The shop is in the middle of the street. ^
We do not know where it is. ^
It is cold to the point where I need a coat. ^
The president of the United States spoke. ^
In the Middle East cultures blend. ^
What do you mean by that? ^
They ran as if they were chased. ^
In the process of learning he found it to be true. ^
In New York City life buzzes. ^
In the absence of light it was dark. ^
I do not think you understand. ^
She did not want to go. ^
This is one of my favorite songs. ^
Do you have any questions? ^
In the direction of home you will find it. ^
He walked up and down the hallway. ^
At the center of the city you will find it. ^
All of a sudden it started raining. ^
I want to talk about your grades. ^
He lives on the other side of the city. ^
It was going to rain. ^
It has been more than a year. ^
I do not even know him. ^
It had nothing to do with me. ^
The key was at the bottom of the box. ^

What does it have to do with the case? ^
I know what to do. ^

She is the head of the department. ^
I will be gone for a couple of days. ^
In the name of love he bought a house. ^
Take a look at the menu. ^

They offer a wide range of services. ^
The role of the teacher is very important. ^

They do not know that secret. ^
It was as if she knew. ^
He visited the United States in summer. ^
They do not think the plan will work. ^
Walk to the end of the road. ^
And I did not see him. ^
The extent to which it will affect us is unknown. ^
I just want to help. ^
I think it was him. ^
In addition to the cost we have to give our time. ^
The United States and Canada are neighbors. ^
I do not understand you. ^
I think this is enough. ^
We arrived at the same time. ^
Because of the fact that it is true. ^
Im trying to figure out the problem. ^
He is at the top of his class. ^
I do not like that. ^
Let me tell you a story. ^
In the number of days. ^
It has to do with respect. ^
I did not think it was possible. ^
The majority of the people agreed. ^
I can tell you a story. ^
Are we going to leave? ^
I do not know her. ^
She knows a lot of things. ^
To be one of the team is his dream. ^
In the middle of the night she left. ^
I have to say it is good. ^
It did not seem to matter. ^
You have the right to remain silent. ^
And we do not agree. ^
Never underestimate the power of the mind. ^
The first time I saw snow I was amazed. ^
He woke up in the middle of a dream. ^
This law is for the United States. ^

In the midst of chaos he left for home. ^
Why dont you come over? ^
I think that the idea is good. ^
She came home as part of the plan. ^
He painted both sides of the fence. ^
And you do not understand. ^

The grass is greener on the other side of the road. ^
It has to be perfect. ^
It was time to go. ^
In the White House decisions are made. ^
He was not going to give up. ^
They do not think it matters. ^
You do not have to go. ^
How do you know that? ^
There are so many books to read. ^
I really do not care. ^
I saw her for the first time today. ^
She knows the subject as well as the teacher. ^
The boat floated on the surface of the water. ^
It turned out to be a mistake. ^
And there was a cat. ^
We walked all the way to the park. ^
You do not know her. ^
It is difficult to say. ^
I do not believe that is true. ^
They do not know the answer. ^
And I think that is right. ^
He left a couple of years ago. ^
It does not matter now. ^
That I do not know. ^
In the way of progress it is good for the nation. ^
I might not be able to come over. ^
At the turn of the century things changed. ^
I would like to see the menu. ^
Let us go back to the beginning. ^
You need to get out of the house. ^
In the back of the car was a book. ^
And the fact that it is true. ^
I do not even know him. ^
He felt a tap on the back of his neck. ^
Do you think the team will win? ^
In an effort to help she got job. ^
I do not think we should go. ^
I thought it was funny. ^
We are going to the movies. ^
He is more likely to be late. ^
These are some of the reasons. ^
He parked on the side of the road. ^
The two of them left together. ^
We did not have enough money. ^
You know what I mean. ^
She did not have the key. ^
It is important to remember. ^
It seemed as if it were magic. ^
The park is in the heart of the city. ^
We do not think there is a chance. ^
It was one of those days. ^
At the time of the accident we saw her. ^
This is the first time in years I have been here. ^
We saw them in front of a crowd. ^
We are on the way to the park. ^
Take a look at this picture. ^
What do you think about this? ^
But I think that is wrong. ^
It is part of the plan. ^
It was a mistake on the part of the team. ^
He has been gone for more than a week. ^
We do not think that is right. ^
This is the way to the park. ^
The label was on the back of the bottle. ^
We do not have any time left. ^
It would have to be done by today. ^
We do not know if it is true. ^
I know that a lot of people agree. ^
There were cookies and a lot of candy. ^
Thank you very much for your help. ^
Over the course of the week things improved. ^
We talked in the living room. ^
To be able to read is important. ^
The vast majority of people agree. ^
As far as the eye can see. ^
I eat out once in a while. ^
He is known as one of the best. ^
I do not see the problem. ^
The rest of the world is different. ^
In the first place why? ^
I hoped that it would be sunny. ^
But you do not understand. ^
Just a little bit of salt is enough. ^
One of the most important things. ^
President of the United States. ^
I will tell you the rest of the story later. ^
At a time when it mattered. ^
Everyone with the exception of Joe arrived on time. ^
He read it in the New York Times. ^
There are a lot of stars. ^
At the beginning of the year he went home. ^
He is one of the best. ^
It is going to be sunny. ^
The size of the room surprised her. ^
He does not have to agree. ^
Fans are all over the country. ^
You are going to have to decide. ^
And I want to help. ^
In the course of a day they made it home. ^
The fact that they arrived early was surprising. ^
But I do not care. ^
He waited in the front of the line. ^
I think it is time. ^
It can be used to clean books. ^
I would like to help. ^
And I do not agree. ^
Do you think it will rain? ^
As long as the sun shines we will go. ^
Do you want to be a doctor? ^
I did not think it was possible. ^
I think it was him. ^
I believe that there is a solution. ^
The two of them left together. ^
Are we going to leave? ^
She is visiting from the United States. ^
The fact that he lied was disappointing. ^

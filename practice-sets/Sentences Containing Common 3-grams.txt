First of all let us eat. ^
Do you want to take a walk? ^
It does not matter. ^
We offer a variety of choices. ^
They want to come too. ^
Travel around the world. ^
It is a matter of time. ^
Stand in front of the line. ^
I tried but it was too late. ^
He stopped in the middle of the road. ^
What are you doing? ^
He said that he had finished. ^
The problem is that it wont work. ^
You have to try. ^
This is not right. ^
The best in the world. ^
In the heart of the city. ^
Look at the side of the building. ^
She walked out of the room. ^
I want to go home. ^
He did not answer. ^
I know a little bit. ^
On the other hand it might work. ^
You can not give up. ^
Any of the books are good. ^
In the process I learned a lot. ^
He is more likely to agree. ^
I want a piece of cake. ^
He did not know what to say. ^
I do not think so. ^
I think he knows. ^
On the basis of facts he is a good guy. ^
But I do care. ^
Try to find out why. ^
Run all the way home. ^
In other words it is over. ^
They are going to come today. ^
It is up to the judge. ^
If you do that it will help. ^
Wait here for a few minutes. ^
In a way you are right. ^
Do you want to go? ^
This is the place. ^
I lived there for a while. ^
This is what I mean. ^
I need a lot more time. ^
The idea of freedom is important. ^
You would have to ask her. ^
He is a man who cares. ^
It will be fun. ^
I think they left. ^
It was just a dream. ^
They did not agree. ^
That is the kind of thing I like. ^
Take a look at this. ^
There will be a test tomorrow. ^
On the side of the other building. ^
She caught up on the news. ^
She is one of us. ^
Take time to look at the stars. ^
It concerns all of us. ^
To be a leader is hard. ^
In the middle of the night she left. ^
Dont stand in the way. ^
We have a problem. ^
And that is all. ^
There was no reason to go. ^
When it comes to math she is the best. ^
The people who work here are nice. ^
Come up with a plan. ^
Fruits such as the apple are sweet. ^
She did not know him. ^
Do you want to come with us? ^
There has been a mistake. ^
All of the time. ^
I bought a pair of shoes. ^
I think that it is good. ^
It is supposed to be sunny. ^
One of the things I love is music. ^
He is at the top of the class. ^
It is down to the wire. ^
I was not aware. ^
This is not a drill. ^
It is one of his best works. ^
We need to get to the airport. ^
In the new year lets travel. ^
I know that there are people in there. ^
To get the best results work hard. ^
And it is true. ^
There is excitement in the air. ^
And if you go she will be there. ^
We will have to see. ^
We should go to the park. ^
In the middle of the night. ^
Stay as long as you want. ^
I cant wait to see the movie. ^
The end of the day is relaxing. ^
The opening of the new store was today. ^
Go back to the start. ^
I had to go home. ^
The majority of people agree. ^
I was a student. ^
It would be a good idea. ^
What are you going to do now? ^
It is a very good idea. ^
I did not expect you to do that. ^
He wants to make a change. ^
I have to talk to you. ^
We said the same thing. ^
That is the way to do it. ^
For the first time I saw snow. ^
The nature of the problem is serious. ^
In order to succeed work hard. ^
I think the plan will work. ^
And I was there. ^
When you look at the sky what do you see? ^
Do you have time? ^
The process of learning is ongoing. ^
Both men and women competed. ^
I want to be able to run. ^
I care as much as you. ^
I can not agree more. ^
This kind of thing happens. ^
I could not sleep. ^
She is a member of the club. ^
For the rest of the day Im free. ^
Stand in front of the camera. ^
It is as if he knew. ^
We can not ignore this. ^
He had a great idea. ^
I have a question. ^
They do not understand. ^
I ate half of the cake. ^
The next day he left. ^
I knew that he was tired. ^
I think i can. ^
It needs to be fixed. ^
Think about it for a moment. ^
Im not going to the party. ^
In the late afternoon it rained. ^
What kind of music do you like? ^
You do not need help. ^
Governor of the state spoke. ^
Its been a long time. ^
I want to be a doctor. ^
And it was dark. ^
News spread all over the town. ^
She said that it was ready. ^
All you have to do is try. ^
He had been there before. ^
It is not far. ^
You need to study. ^
They were going to meet. ^
Please take care of the cat. ^
It has to be perfect. ^
To make sure check it twice. ^
I think we should go. ^
See you in the morning. ^
Its been a few years. ^
He grew up in the city. ^
We did not agree to that. ^
The cat sat on top of the roof. ^
Members of the team are here. ^
He took the book out of his bag. ^
It is the event of the year. ^
It is a cat. ^
In the time of kings it was hard to find food. ^
That we have time is good. ^
It is a way to learn. ^
Look at the other side of the street. ^
The state of the union is strong. ^
The things that matter are simple. ^
Do not you worry. ^
At the end of the day. ^
It is likely to be sunny. ^
At the same time it was raining. ^
In different parts of the world. ^
Some of them left early. ^
Most of the time it works. ^
He has the ability to run fast. ^
The federal government decided. ^
They do not want to leave. ^
I think that is right. ^
Put it in the box. ^
She went to the store. ^
He is one of them. ^
I need to get a new book. ^
She was the first to arrive. ^
He wanted to play outside. ^
To have the answer is satisfying. ^
The owner of the house is here. ^
You can see the stars tonight. ^
And I think so. ^
He was not ready. ^
And he was late. ^
I do not know how to swim. ^
She wrote a series of books. ^
He is a member of the national team. ^
I would have gone. ^
I wanted to ask. ^
Much of the work is done. ^
It is more than a game. ^
I do not like that. ^
To deal with problems is part of life. ^
He sat in the back row. ^
For the next few days Ill be out of town. ^
In the next few days call me. ^
There is a problem. ^
On the other hand it might rain. ^
I thought that I was late. ^
It is one of the most beautiful places. ^
It would be nice. ^
You do not have to go. ^
The most important thing is health. ^
That was the best day. ^
The book is on the floor. ^
I hope that this is right. ^
She sings as well as she dances. ^
By the time we arrived she was gone. ^
They have been a great help. ^
And I have seen it. ^
I have to tell you a secret. ^
He was able to solve it. ^
That is the way to do it. ^
Two of the same kind. ^
Im going to get groceries. ^
In the last few days its been cold. ^
In the future we will see. ^
He was in the army. ^
The president of the company spoke. ^
The number of birds increased. ^
We do not know. ^
We have to leave now. ^
He is part of the team. ^
She was a kind person. ^
How do you feel? ^
It was the first time I saw it. ^
It is three and a half feet. ^
And I do care. ^
It is going to take some time. ^
In the age of technology it is good. ^
We need to talk. ^
I do not see it. ^
Leaves fell on the ground. ^
The streets of New York are busy. ^
When I was a child I loved books. ^
I have to study. ^
I did not see it. ^
When she was here she helped a lot. ^
It was good back in the day ^
He decided to do it. ^
Its a kind of magic. ^
On the side of the road you will find it. ^
A group of kids played. ^
The cat is on the roof. ^
The book is in the bag. ^
He had to leave early. ^
To be an artist takes skill. ^
We do not understand. ^
In the first place think about it. ^
I think there is a chance. ^
You do not understand. ^
It is the best. ^
In the United States it is popular. ^
At the beginning of the year we will see. ^
The story of her life is interesting. ^
In terms of quality its the best. ^
I did not have time. ^
The need for food is basic. ^
She does not have the key. ^
The role of a teacher is important. ^
Its one of the best. ^
If you want I can come home. ^
He is going to school. ^
It turned out to be true. ^
She has been gone for a long time. ^
I know what to do. ^
It had been a long day. ^
I have been able to learn. ^
Choose between the two options. ^
And there was silence. ^
You have to be brave. ^
I need a couple of minutes. ^
In the case of rain bring an umbrella. ^
But I think differently. ^
In the face of danger turn to family. ^
The size of the room is big. ^
It was a joke. ^
At the top of the mountain you will find it. ^
Each of the days. ^
She did not go. ^
The presence of water is a good thing. ^
By the way thanks. ^
But it is true. ^
For the rest of the day go home. ^
A situation in which the outcome is uncertain. ^
I believe that there is hope. ^
In the heart of the city you will find it. ^
According to the news it is good. ^
The use of computers is widespread. ^
I had a good time. ^
It is in one of the boxes. ^
Thank you very much. ^
In the past things were different. ^
The United States is large. ^
We want to learn more. ^
He was one of the first to arrive. ^
At the bottom of the sea you will find it ^
See you at the end. ^
Of all the books this is the best. ^
I will try to make it on time. ^
He has been waiting for more than an hour. ^
He learned a lot over the years. ^
Its a result of hard work. ^
The white house is over there. ^
That used to be mine. ^
And the other one? ^
We arrived at the same time. ^
The president of the country spoke. ^
It may not be true. ^
In the name of love come home. ^
To be able to read is important. ^
More and more people arrived. ^
That would be great. ^
The importance of health is known. ^
She tried to make the team. ^
Wonders of the world are amazing. ^
Leaders of the nation met. ^
To be the best takes effort. ^
That does not matter. ^
I have to go to school. ^
You know what to do. ^
Look at the stars. ^
Send it to the office. ^
In this country we value freedom. ^
I have not seen him. ^
The American people voted. ^
It is some kind of bird. ^
Are we going to go soon? ^
Everyone has the right to speak. ^
To be in love is wonderful. ^
He did not want to go. ^
If you have time lets meet. ^
In the course of a day we will see. ^
He sat at the back of the room. ^
It would not be fair. ^
It had to be done. ^
It is not the end. ^
I like that kind of music. ^
I do not know. ^
We are in the same boat. ^
We are going to have dinner soon. ^
I have to do my homework. ^
There is no time to waste. ^
The New York Times reported. ^
I would like to go too. ^
One step at a time. ^
You did not tell me. ^
It is good to have a friend. ^
There are no excuses left. ^
Over the past year much has changed. ^
There are a few options. ^
You need to get out of bed. ^
When he was young he traveled. ^
There were many people in the park. ^
Some of the people left early. ^
A number of people agreed. ^
It was the last one. ^
He was a kind man. ^
I would not do that. ^
I regret to say that it is true. ^
What do you want to do? ^
That can be arranged. ^
He said that there was a problem. ^
He reached the top of the mountain. ^
He lies all the time. ^
Most of the people agreed. ^
Based on the facts we will win. ^
He is the chairman of the board. ^
Its part of a plan. ^
Most of the time it works. ^
The United Nations met today. ^
We live in the country. ^
In the early morning it is quiet. ^
At this point we wait. ^
It has nothing to do with you. ^
She is the director of the company. ^
She is trying to get a job. ^
I do not have it. ^
She lives in New York. ^
This can not be true. ^
He had to take the test. ^
It seemed to be working. ^
And this is it. ^
He is a member of the club. ^
The possibility of rain is high. ^
Sometimes you have to wait. ^
Do not get lost. ^
It is cold because of the wind. ^
At the end of the road you will find it. ^
It is going to be a great day. ^
Everyone in the house was asleep. ^
It was one of the best days. ^
There have been many changes. ^
I hope that they are happy. ^
In the case of an emergency call me ^
He would not have known. ^
It would have been easier. ^
I was in the garden. ^
There was a loud noise. ^
You are a part of this. ^
They seem to be happy. ^
He moved to the United States. ^
Many of the cats are asleep. ^
I heard that she was here. ^
I know how to cook. ^
In the end it all worked out. ^
On the edge of the bed. ^
He sat at the edge of the table. ^
As a result he won. ^
I will try to help. ^
I wonder whether or not he will come. ^
Lets go back to the beginning. ^
The president of the American company spoke. ^
He did well as the leader. ^
In this case you are right. ^
She is out in the garden. ^
A lot of people came. ^
Meet me at the center of town. ^
In recent years things have changed. ^
Thank you very much. ^
She cares a great deal. ^
What do you think? ^
He does not know. ^
He traveled to the Middle East. ^
As far as I know. ^
They do not want to go. ^
It seems to be broken. ^
It may be late. ^
In addition to this there is more. ^
The fact that you came is good. ^
There will be a meeting. ^
Do you know her? ^
He made it out of a box. ^
A citizen of the United States. ^
They have to leave early. ^
This is a book. ^

As part of the team. ^
People who are kind make a difference. ^

She said that they were friends. ^
At the time I was young. ^
It can be easy. ^
We have to go now. ^
You need to be careful. ^
We need to talk about your grades. ^
We do not have a choice. ^
She chose to do so. ^
The sound of music is lovely. ^
It was not easy. ^
The history of the world is long. ^
Remember to keep the door closed. ^
But in the end she will win ^
You have a choice. ^
The lack of water is a problem. ^
When it comes to games he is the best. ^
It was one of those days. ^
She is the head of the department. ^
He could not believe it. ^
It could be worse. ^
Fifty percent of the group agreed. ^
I have a sense of joy. ^
I think you are right. ^
Take a chance to win. ^
Call me as soon as possible. ^
He does not have it. ^
She was going to call. ^
It has been fun. ^
It did not happen. ^
And in the end it will work out. ^
Stay away from the edge. ^
I need to find a solution. ^
The United States and Canada are neighbors. ^
Please take care of the cat. ^
In the end it all worked out. ^
I need to get a new book. ^
The next day he left. ^

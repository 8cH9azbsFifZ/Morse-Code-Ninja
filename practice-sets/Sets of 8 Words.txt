this is just the tip of the iceberg ^
the last thing you want to do is ^
a lot of it has to do with ^
we have a lot of work to do ^
that there is no such thing as a ^
not to put too fine a point on ^
in the first three months of the year ^
to get from point a to point b ^
who did not want to be named said ^
but the fact of the matter is that ^
life in prison without the possibility of parole ^
want to thank you for being with us ^
it is important to keep in mind that ^
there is still a long way to go ^
what are you going to do about it ^
doing the same thing over and over again ^
i think the best compliment i can give ^
all good things must come to an end ^
a funny thing happened on the way to ^
it should come as no surprise that the ^
for the second year in a row the ^
so it should come as no surprise that ^
years later lets finally heed the call of ^
i will do everything in my power to ^
there are going to be a lot of ^
this is not the first time that the ^
if you have any questions feel free to ^
the full faith and credit of the united ^
do as i say not as i do ^
all you have to do is look at ^
the enemy of my enemy is my friend ^
has taken on a life of its own ^
put your money where your mouth is and ^
the more things change the more they stay ^
there has never been a better time to ^
there has been a lot of talk about ^
seemed like a good idea at the time ^
thank you from the bottom of my heart ^
im going to go out on a limb ^
there was no way i was going to ^
the more i think about it the more ^
beauty is in the eye of the beholder ^
for the first time in my life i ^
the more i thought about it the more ^
is the latest in a long line of ^
the first thing we need to do is ^
there are a lot of people out there ^
to make it as easy as possible for ^
ive said it before and ill say it ^
wake up in the middle of the night ^
in the first six months of this year ^
i would like to take this opportunity to ^
and the rest as they say is history ^
was the straw that broke the camels back ^
can you tell us a little bit about ^
but at the end of the day its ^
go down in history as one of the ^
for the first time in the history of ^
the land of the free and the home ^
i hope you can see your way clear ^
if youre new here you may want to ^
on the one hand and on the other ^
but at the end of the day i ^
to come to terms with the fact that ^
the gap between the rich and the poor ^
this is the first in a series of ^
to give him the benefit of the doubt ^
if you are interested in learning more about ^
a force to be reckoned with in the ^
the first thing you need to do is ^
of the people by the people and for ^
i think it is fair to say that ^
spend the rest of his life in prison ^
no deal is better than a bad deal ^
out of the corner of my eye i ^
one of the best if not the best ^
in the oval office of the white house ^
in the first three months of this year ^
the same can not be said for the ^
right of the people to keep and bear ^
this is a step in the right direction ^
what to do and what not to do ^
was the best thing that ever happened to ^
let me know if you have any questions ^
in what can only be described as a ^
and let the chips fall where they may ^
what difference at this point does it make ^

caught between a rock and a hard place ^
i had no idea what i was doing ^
you may pay the cost if you do ^
the president of the united states of america ^
there are a lot of people who are ^
at all hours of the day and night ^
to take the law into their own hands ^
i dont know what im going to do ^
how i learned to stop worrying and love ^
to the left and to the right of ^
stuck between a rock and a hard place ^
but it doesnt have to be that way ^
when was the last time you saw a ^
the road to hell is paved with good ^
have something to do with the fact that ^
ask not what your country can do for ^
is in the final year of his contract ^
is greater than the sum of its parts ^
the whole truth and nothing but the truth ^
the fact of the matter is that the ^
there is no limit to the number of ^
i cant think of a better way to ^
it is only a matter of time before ^
the first thing that comes to mind is ^
the only way to do that is to ^
this is why we cant have nice things ^
we will do everything in our power to ^
and theres nothing you can do about it ^
day of christmas my true love gave to ^

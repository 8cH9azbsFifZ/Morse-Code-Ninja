Thank you both very much for your help. ^
He did not know what to do with the gift. ^
I do not even know her name. ^
I will remember this for the rest of my life. ^
He was at the other end of the hall. ^
She stood to the side of the door. ^
He parked on the side of the road. ^
What do you think about the plan? ^
So I do not think it is a good idea. ^
There were trees on both sides of the road. ^
He walked in the direction of the park. ^
In the midst of the celebration he smiled. ^
He did not know what to say. ^
Are you going to be able to come? ^
He was different from the rest of the group. ^
She did not want to leave. ^
I have known her for more than a year. ^
To be able to do this is great. ^
What do you make of this situation? ^
He is not going to be able to join us. ^
One of the things that matters is honesty. ^
They did not want to leave early. ^
The President of the United States gave a speech. ^
They want to go back to school. ^
He did not know what to say. ^
I think a lot of people agree. ^
They did not want to go home. ^
In the middle of the night I heard a noise. ^
She ignored the fact that he was right. ^
Climb to the top of the mountain. ^
The news spread to the rest of the country. ^
In the last couple of weeks much has changed. ^
I do not know why it happened. ^
What are you doing here so early? ^
You do not have to go there. ^
He is going to have to work late. ^
We do not have any more cookies. ^
I woke up in the middle of the night. ^
It is going to have to be fixed. ^
You do not have to be perfect. ^
Trust is at the heart of their relationship. ^
And one of the things I love is music. ^
It may or may not be true. ^
At a time when the market was down. ^
They do not want to talk about it. ^
I do not have time to explain. ^
The President of the United States and his team met. ^
Meet me at the base of the hill. ^
He went in and out of the room. ^
He walked all the way to the store. ^
Thank you so much for joining us today. ^
I think we have to go now. ^
We must find a way to agree. ^
I do not want to see that movie. ^
This is one of the most popular shows. ^
I do not see how that will work. ^
We celebrated the end of the cold season. ^
And I do not think it is right. ^
Our house is on the far side of the lake. ^
But I do not know the answer. ^
He tried to get out of the room. ^
He wrote an article for The New York Times. ^
It is the right thing to do. ^
To tell you the truth I was nervous. ^
I would like to see it. ^
I have a lot of books. ^
Trade agreements exist between the United States and Canada. ^
I do not want to do chores. ^
I do not think you understand. ^
Thank you for being with us today. ^
I thought it was a joke. ^
For the first time since March it snowed. ^
From the point of view of a child it is huge. ^
She was a member of the team. ^
She was one of the first to arrive. ^
The fact of the matter is we were wrong. ^
We need to make sure that the doors are locked. ^
Sign your name on the back of the paper. ^
I met him a couple of weeks ago. ^
What are you going to do about it? ^
I do not think the plan will work. ^
I can tell you that its a good plan. ^
It has a lot to do with luck. ^
Thank you for joining us at the event. ^
They are more likely to be successful. ^
At the end of the day we were tired. ^
Take a look at this picture. ^
I was going to say that. ^
In the center of the city there is a park. ^
You have to be able to swim. ^
He did not have to say anything. ^
He managed to study while at the same time working. ^
In other parts of the country its very different. ^
I have not been able to sleep. ^
I did not have a chance to speak. ^
I did not know that was possible. ^
Thank you very much for your time. ^
I do not think it matters. ^
It had nothing to do with luck. ^
At the time of the accident it was raining. ^
We do not know what the future holds. ^
That was one of the best days. ^
I have to tell you a secret. ^
There are a number of reasons for this. ^
And I did not want to leave. ^
In the heart of the city there is a park. ^
She waited at the front of the line. ^
We want to make sure that everyone is safe. ^
We strive to meet the needs of our clients. ^
We do not have a lot of time. ^
I do not know what I want. ^
This has nothing to do with that. ^
We played better in the second half of the game. ^
It was the first time she saw snow. ^
He sat on the floor of the room. ^
I did not want to be late. ^
I do not know who did it. ^
I do not think that is a good idea. ^
I would not want to go without it. ^
It has been a year and a half. ^
By the end of the week we will have an answer. ^
All you have to do is try. ^
You do not have a problem. ^
It was one of the hardest decisions. ^
I do not need to buy that. ^
It is about the size of a lemon. ^
He spent the rest of his life writing. ^
In the past two years I have learned a lot. ^
Add salt and pepper to taste. ^
And a lot of people agreed. ^
The end of the war brought peace. ^
Water is one of the most important resources. ^
We do not know if it is true. ^
It turned out to be a great party. ^
She is a leader and a member of the team. ^
She is one of the few experts in this field. ^
It should be noted that the rules have changed. ^
It is important to do the right thing. ^
I cannot think of a better idea. ^
Thank you very much for being with us. ^
I do not want you to leave. ^
I knew it was going to be a challenge. ^
All of us here at the office agree. ^
To be part of the team is an honor. ^
More than half of the class passed. ^
I do not know that person. ^
I do not want to get wet. ^
He sat at the edge of the bed. ^
And at the same time it began to rain. ^
With the help of a friend I finished the project. ^
He would not be able to come today. ^
They do not know how to swim. ^
This image can not be represented in black and white. ^
They do not know what they want. ^
You know what I mean right? ^
How do you feel about the new plan? ^
There is an increase in the number of cars. ^
We need to figure out how to solve this. ^
I do not want you to leave. ^
We do not want to leave. ^
As in the case of John we must be careful. ^
He parked at the far end of the lot. ^
We do not know what to do. ^
He learns in the same way that she does. ^
Say goodbye to the rest of the team. ^
The flag was at the top of the pole. ^
But on the other hand there are risks. ^
It is important to note that details matter. ^
I think it would be fun. ^
I do not want to go outside. ^
I think there is a problem. ^
It has to do with your attitude. ^
The game changed in the second half of the match. ^
This is not to say that its impossible. ^
It is hard but at the same time rewarding. ^
He walked to the far end of the street. ^
It is not going to be easy. ^
In this part of the town it is quieter. ^
We heard the talk of the nation from the radio. ^
Thank you very much for joining us. ^
I was not going to tell. ^
And I do not want to go. ^
We need to get rid of the clutter. ^
A park lay on the far side of the river. ^
It does not have to be this way. ^
I do not know what to do next. ^
There was a time when we were close. ^
It has to do with the way it is made. ^
I do not know anything about cars. ^
I know that a lot of people agree. ^
Thank you very much for being with us. ^
I do not have to go today. ^
Go to the back of the line. ^
And when we come back we will talk more. ^
There are a lot of people in the park. ^
I want to travel for the rest of my life. ^
We still have a long way to go. ^
Thank you so much for your help. ^
He traveled for the rest of his life. ^
I do not think there is a chance. ^
From the point of view of a child it is huge. ^
Thanks for being with us tonight. ^
I did not mean to upset you. ^
I want to go back to the beach. ^
If you do not like the food we can eat somewhere else. ^
She glanced out of the corner of her eye. ^
The store is on the other side of the street. ^
The first half of the game was exciting. ^
He does not want to discuss it. ^
I do not want to be late. ^
Over the course of the year things changed. ^
As far as I know it is true. ^
I do not think you can lift it. ^
We do not have to hurry. ^
You cant do that here. ^
Toward the end of the book it gets exciting. ^
The United States and the European Union reached an agreement. ^
In the midst of a crisis they remained calm. ^
He did not want to talk about it. ^
A couple of years ago things were different. ^
Im excited to be a part of this. ^
I do not think I can do it. ^
I will not be able to attend the meeting. ^
I do not know if I can come home right now. ^
I do not know what it means. ^
There was a mistake on the part of the staff. ^
It took an hour and a half to get there. ^
He acted as if it were a joke. ^
One of the things I enjoy is reading. ^
This is the first time I have seen it. ^
You do not know what you are missing. ^
In the back of the book you will find the answers. ^
She appeared on Talk of the Nation. ^
What do you think of the new design? ^
I do not know what to cook. ^
It seems to me that you are right. ^
It does not have to be perfect. ^
Changes will happen over the next five years. ^
In the case of the missing item call this number. ^
This is one of the best books I have read. ^
The good news is that everyone is safe. ^
Their house is on the edge of the forest. ^
In the aftermath of the storm we helped each other. ^
She had no choice but to agree. ^
I do not think so. ^
It turned out to be a great day. ^
As a result of the storm schools closed. ^
The gift came in the form of a letter. ^
I do not believe that story. ^
When I was a kid I loved to play outside. ^
The rest of the world seems so far away. ^
What are you going to do next? ^
I think one of the keys is lost. ^
These are some of the things that matter. ^
She may not be able to come. ^
The results of this study are promising. ^
And for the first time I understood. ^
I do not have any money. ^
We are not going to give up. ^
In the last two years I have learned so much. ^
At the start of the race everyone was excited. ^
You do not have to worry about it. ^
Does this have anything to do with me? ^
What are you talking about? ^
The purpose of this study was to understand the pattern. ^
They do not have the key. ^
He was not going to give up. ^
I did not have to work late today. ^
The United States and Canada share a border. ^
You do not have to worry about it. ^

As a member of the team I agree. ^
It is one of the oldest cities. ^
The President of the United States gave a speech. ^
When it comes to the final exam Im ready. ^
He said that he was going to come. ^
She read it in The New York Times. ^
I do not want to have dessert. ^
I do not think we should go. ^
The key is at the bottom of the box. ^
At the end of a long day he relaxed. ^
We got to the bottom of the mystery. ^
All you have to do is try. ^
He spent a lot of time working. ^
He stood out from the rest of the group. ^
Do you want me to help? ^
I do not know how to swim. ^
We do not have a choice. ^
In the last few years the city has grown. ^
They were on the way to the market. ^
In the eyes of the children everything was magical. ^
He is an integral part of the team. ^
If you do not want to go its okay. ^
I do not want to go there. ^
We walked to the end of the road. ^
People came from all over the world. ^
This is going to be the best day ever. ^
I do not know if you heard the news. ^
You do not need to hurry. ^
What are we going to eat? ^
I want to show you something. ^
They do not have to go today. ^
I think this is a good idea. ^
If it were not for you I could not go. ^
I do not have the time for that. ^
I did not know what to do. ^
He does not seem to be happy. ^
As a matter of fact I was there. ^
But when it comes to cooking she is an expert. ^
He did not know how to swim. ^
It had something to do with his past. ^
This is important for all of us here. ^
Here in the United States we value freedom. ^
Every once in a while I read a book. ^
A lot of people are talking about it. ^
I will be busy for the rest of the day. ^
And the rest of the team followed. ^
I do not think she noticed. ^
It will happen one way or the other. ^
Season the food with salt and pepper. ^
I think a lot of people agree. ^
There is talk of the nations future. ^
He was going to be late. ^
In the history of the school this was a first. ^
What are we going to do now? ^
Why dont you just relax for a bit? ^
He is known as one of the most talented. ^
I do not have a car. ^
In the middle of a storm the ship sailed on. ^
I think we need to talk. ^
I do not see any problem here. ^
It is not surprising that he won. ^
In the context of the story his actions make sense. ^
I think it was a mistake. ^
My friend lives at the other end of the city. ^
A lot of people have doubts. ^
There are a lot of things that matter. ^
In the hands of the cook the ingredients came alive. ^
Dont forget to take advantage of the sale. ^
Arrange it in such a way that everyone can see. ^
I was going to be late. ^
As a result of this event we changed our plans. ^
Im going to take a break now. ^
Let me ask you this question. ^
That is one of the reasons why I left. ^
For the first time in years I felt happy. ^
On the eve of the festival excitement was high. ^
I do not know about the meeting. ^
There are a lot of people waiting. ^
Fashion changed at the turn of the century. ^
I do not care if it rains. ^
The shop is at the end of the street. ^
When you look at the sky what do you see? ^
To be one of the winners is amazing. ^
It is one of the most beautiful places. ^
Let us take a look at the map. ^
There are going to be many challenges ahead. ^
I waited for a very long time. ^
I cannot tell you how much this means to me. ^
She stayed there for the rest of the summer. ^
He sat at the head of the table. ^
Over the course of the year things changed. ^
I spend a lot of time reading. ^
A fence ran on one side of the field. ^
The President leads the United States of America. ^
I do not think they will agree. ^
We are glad to have you with us. ^
In the wake of the storm we rebuilt. ^
I do not mean to interrupt. ^
He walked to the edge of the cliff. ^
In the past few years things have changed. ^
She arrived at the same time that the meeting started. ^
He showed what it means to be brave. ^
And I do not know why. ^
There is a lot of joy here. ^
Houses stood on either side of the street. ^
Im trying to figure out what happened. ^
He parked on the side of the road. ^
It is a little bit of a challenge. ^
A man and a woman were walking together. ^
I do not know if I can come home. ^
In the face of the challenge she remained strong. ^
They do not want to talk about it. ^
It is going to be a long day. ^
At the beginning of the story there was silence. ^
Let us take a look at the map. ^
She went with the rest of the group. ^
I do not know where it is. ^
I do not like to wake up early. ^
But I do not think that is a good idea. ^
I do not know what to say. ^
I do not want to hear excuses. ^
Its been two and a half years. ^
If you do not have the book I can lend it to you. ^
Tomorrow is going to be a sunny day. ^
But I do not want to go there. ^
I want to be able to swim. ^
This is one of the best days. ^
That was one of the most exciting games. ^
In the first half of the book the plot thickens. ^
What do you say to a movie tonight? ^
There are a lot of stars out tonight. ^
And I think that the idea is good. ^
Thank you for being with us. ^
Our cat sleeps at the foot of the bed. ^
In the rest of the city life went on as usual. ^
At the height of the summer its very hot. ^
And at the end of the day we were tired. ^
I do not care what they think. ^
How are you going to solve this? ^
The largest city in the United States is New York. ^
It is time to do something about it. ^
A lot of people do that. ^
And all of a sudden it was quiet. ^
This has nothing to do with the problem. ^
You do not have to worry. ^
What do you want to eat? ^
He sat at the back of the room. ^
She stood at the center of the room. ^
Do not worry about it it is fine. ^
We do not have the time. ^

I do not think he will come. ^
There is no doubt that she is right. ^
You do not want to be late. ^
We are going to have to decide. ^
At the turn of the century things changed rapidly. ^
I want to ask you a question. ^
This is popular in the United States and Europe. ^
Some feared it was the end of the world. ^
And if you do not mind I will join. ^
The extent to which the law applies varies. ^
Move to the front of the line. ^
You will remember this for the rest of your life. ^
At the end of this road turn left. ^
There were a lot of stars visible last night. ^
It was going to be a surprise. ^
This has nothing to do with you. ^
He waited for a long period of time. ^
Let me tell you something important. ^
Let me ask you about your plans. ^
I do not know whether to go or stay. ^
If you look at the map we are here. ^
I will be back in a moment. ^

The fact of the matter is we were late. ^
We plan to finish by the end of the year. ^

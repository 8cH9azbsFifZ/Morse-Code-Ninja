She has a new idea. ^
You have my thanks. ^
Be able to help. ^
She went on a journey. ^
Meet me at the house. ^
It could be better. ^
The fact is interesting. ^
Its been quiet since the party. ^
The hat sat on his head. ^
It is an apple. ^
There is no time. ^
Look at this. ^
In front of us. ^
The sun rose over the hills. ^
Try not to worry. ^
A good book can be very engaging. ^
We need to talk soon. ^
I have a lot to do. ^
Its been a while. ^
The cat ran across the road. ^
I mean well. ^
A small bird sang in the tree. ^
Sing as we walk. ^
I knew that he would come. ^
They told stories of their adventures. ^
I think that its true. ^
We are with the group. ^
Fast as the wind. ^
I have a story to tell. ^
I heard that they arrived. ^
It is kind of nice. ^
He tried to call. ^
Try to keep calm. ^
We love of our childhood. ^
It can be easy. ^
Its time to go. ^
Everyone has to try. ^
Did you call her? ^
We have a plan. ^
He built his own house. ^
I would but I cant. ^
Do as you wish. ^
And what will you do now? ^
The book is of his writing. ^
Do not go there. ^
They set out to explore. ^
In the park. ^
She had a very nice smile. ^
Laugh as he jokes. ^
Would you like to go? ^
Stop because I said. ^
Its not the same. ^
In fact yes. ^
A number of people came here. ^
He tried but he failed. ^
He was in the room. ^
A place that is quiet. ^
They were happy when they won. ^
Many of them left. ^
The white cat purred. ^
It should be ready soon. ^
Rest after a long day. ^
In their home. ^
I can help you. ^
He was the one who was late. ^
According to the map we are close. ^
They needed more time and more resources. ^
He was the last to know. ^
A couple walks in the park every morning. ^
I have something to say. ^
Take care of your house. ^
In his room. ^
Succeed because they try. ^
Are you okay? ^
The best of all. ^
It was such a surprise. ^
Thats where the keys are. ^
You can choose the red shirt or the blue one. ^
Wait for it to come. ^
She is the most caring. ^
This is the only way. ^
He had to leave early. ^
Do it for me. ^
He gave it to her. ^
Tell me when you are ready. ^
In my house. ^
I need to go now. ^
You have to see it. ^
He went with her. ^
Do you want to go? ^
Wait for a moment. ^
The cat sat on the window. ^
The cat and the dog were friends. ^
Smile because of joy. ^
She had a good time. ^
That would be great. ^
A little sugar sweetens the tea. ^
Open the door. ^
I was there. ^
And we all cheered loudly. ^
He left for his trip. ^
I just want to say thank you. ^
Look for the book. ^
If I may. ^
People who read often learn much. ^
A lot of stars were visible tonight. ^
Is it ready? ^
What we need is here. ^
The American dream is alive. ^
I will see you when I get there. ^
There is a lot of noise. ^
This year is better. ^
I thought hard. ^
The cat is proud of its catch. ^
The air is fresh. ^
She goes to work early. ^
Now is the time. ^
And in the end they were happy. ^
There were many stars. ^
I wonder of what will come of it. ^
I know but thats hard. ^
Leave as it is. ^
We will go to the park. ^
Tomorrow will be better. ^
I need to get milk. ^
Welcome to a new place. ^
And if it rains we will stay inside. ^
We had a great time. ^
They do their best. ^
She wrote a letter to him. ^
She said it was okay. ^
We can try. ^
They can do it. ^
She would not agree. ^
Can you talk to me? ^
In an hour. ^
I would have gone too. ^
I like the idea. ^
She goes to high school. ^
Work as a team. ^
He leaned against the wall. ^
Not at all bad. ^
I cant keep up with the news. ^
You are the best. ^
In her room. ^
She says hello. ^
A couple of days. ^
There is a chance. ^
I do agree. ^
Wait for the second bell. ^
Who are you talking about? ^
Those who try succeed. ^
What do you think? ^
Its part of a plan. ^
Lets talk about it tomorrow. ^
He knows it and that makes him happy. ^
Learn from the past. ^
He looked out the window. ^
Act as if sure. ^
The man walked away. ^
The cat followed and her tail twitched. ^
He jumped off the dock. ^
She is always kind. ^
We do our best. ^
What do you want? ^
Be a good friend. ^
I said no. ^
Its up to you. ^
It might be true. ^
We meet once a year. ^
Is that true? ^
He read from a book. ^
Take the rest of the day off. ^
I wish you were here. ^
And you can bring a friend. ^
He would help us. ^
I am sure of that. ^
She used to dance. ^
She was popular among the students. ^
What do you think? ^
Twenty percent of the time it works. ^
Do you have the time? ^
Put it in the box. ^
If he comes. ^
Choose action rather than delay. ^
Always try to do your best. ^
He loves to make art. ^
There was a time. ^
None of those fit. ^
Be the first one. ^
Work hard so that you succeed. ^
I had fun. ^
Look at the other side. ^
It does work. ^
The United Nations met. ^
If the plan works. ^
Such as this? ^
A big dog barked loudly. ^
Go back to work. ^
I am going to sleep. ^
The world is round. ^
In which case. ^
Can you see the difference? ^
This is part of my plan. ^
The idea came from his mind. ^
You know best. ^
I know her. ^
I hope that there is cake. ^
Decide based on facts. ^
Few of them understood. ^
Stand by the door. ^
He has a dog. ^
They are happy. ^
Of course Ill come. ^
That was amazing. ^
It is just a thought. ^
You and I will go together. ^
She is one of the best. ^
The number is growing. ^
She collected stamps and other trinkets. ^
I remember when she visited. ^
I think that is right. ^
In your hands. ^
I just know it. ^
Come to the party. ^
What the cat did was funny. ^
A story that has meaning. ^
Shes trying to learn. ^
And so the story begins. ^
What is happening? ^
Not only that but more. ^
He bought an apple and a banana. ^
She wanted to come home. ^
He had a dream. ^
Let us make a plan. ^
The state fair is fun. ^
Its within the rules. ^
Walk through the park. ^
We plan to meet and to discuss. ^
He said that it was true. ^
Who is there? ^
She knows about the plan. ^
There are many stars. ^
It was a good day. ^
Choose big or a small one. ^
I did not think so. ^
I want more. ^
We need to talk. ^
He did well as a leader. ^
He works for the company. ^
It happened years ago. ^
Do you know him? ^
It has been fun. ^
It has been a good day. ^
I wish that we could go home. ^
They were late. ^
She is in school. ^
Send it to me. ^
The responsibility fell on her. ^
I wish that I knew. ^
In the middle of the room. ^
He could run fast. ^
I do not have it. ^
Written by a friend. ^
She came in with a smile. ^
I want none of it. ^
I left early so I arrived on time. ^
He left with an apple. ^
I need more than that. ^
Remember to take your coat. ^
That is one of her books. ^
She is tall enough to reach. ^
You can do it. ^
It may be late. ^
Choose which is best. ^
Its sort of interesting. ^
Tried but they lost. ^
We have arrived. ^
The day was long. ^
He spoke of the legend. ^
Its all right to ask for help. ^
On the other side of the street. ^
It would help. ^
Who are they? ^
I visited last year. ^
Remember to give thanks. ^
Enjoy the rest of the day. ^
All the lights in the house are on. ^
He said it was okay. ^
Choose the right path. ^
We will help each other. ^
Its like a dream. ^
All of us dream. ^
The habits of people vary. ^
He is going home. ^
She says hello. ^
Show me the way. ^
It is a cat. ^
This is the end. ^
She is the one for me. ^
She went to school. ^
They are not here yet. ^
She called from the office. ^
A long road stretched ahead. ^
Let me try. ^
That is what I thought. ^
The goal is to learn. ^
We should talk about it. ^
I read some of the book. ^
Smile as she does. ^
Is the door open? ^
In some cases. ^
A man stood at the bus stop. ^
It must be right. ^
Reach the top shelf. ^
He was able to run fast. ^
Go to the store. ^
It will happen. ^
I do not want it. ^
And there stood a mysterious old house. ^
This was unexpected. ^
In this way. ^
He laughed and she joined in. ^
The US is vast. ^
I have seen it. ^
That would be great. ^
Do it now. ^
He walked out of the room. ^
We are all the same. ^
He said that she went home. ^
It was fun. ^
We were young when we met. ^
They would agree. ^
He was very happy. ^
That is the case. ^
She could not come. ^
Listen to this song. ^
He was the first to arrive. ^
I did my best. ^
Are you aware of this fact? ^
Wait for the next one. ^
You could try. ^
In that case. ^
One of these is different. ^
He has a good sense of humor. ^
The national park is beautiful. ^
He did not know. ^
I hope that you come soon. ^
The house is big. ^
It should not be hard. ^
They have been here. ^
It is not far. ^
They say that its rare. ^
It does not fit. ^
You may have it. ^
Its part of an idea. ^
Faster than the wind. ^
You are right. ^
Better than a dream. ^
Call me when he arrives. ^
We were there. ^
We traveled across the country. ^
Remember to look both ways. ^
He did his best. ^
This is my home. ^
A new school was built nearby. ^
And his dog barked loud. ^
We are ready. ^
It is up to me to decide. ^
You have got to see this. ^
I hope that the day is sunny. ^
Its the way to go. ^
I know that place. ^
If you can. ^
They left early and they arrived on time. ^
I wonder what he wants. ^
Yes it is true. ^
Please pick up the toys. ^
Its a gift for her. ^
The use of technology is increasing. ^
Lets take a break. ^
She played with his dog. ^
Eat before the movie. ^
At the end of the day. ^
The party started after the movie. ^
The president will speak. ^
Let us go when it stops raining. ^
If we try. ^
It was not ready. ^
I hope to see you. ^
I will tell you a secret. ^
It had been a long day. ^
The two friends laughed. ^
I dont like that. ^
Thank you so much. ^
She is the one who had the idea. ^
Stay away from danger. ^
I asked him to come here. ^
I think so. ^
I am here now. ^
Into a room. ^
They have their own ideas. ^
Slow but you finished. ^
She grew up in the city. ^
I know what you mean. ^
First we eat and then we go. ^
Look at a star. ^
The old house stood quietly. ^
That was the plan. ^
They rely on their skills. ^
She had a bright idea. ^
He got up and left. ^
Most of it is gone. ^
Scary but its safe. ^
The children laugh and their joy fills the room. ^
If it rains. ^
She was here earlier. ^
The public needs to know. ^
The new plan is better. ^
Look at this picture. ^
It happened during the night. ^
I could try it. ^
Think as I do. ^
She loves to have fun. ^
Into the night. ^
I can not go. ^
Act as an example. ^
Stand in front of me. ^
I need to get a pen. ^
Try to find it. ^
Books that are interesting. ^
The people gathered around. ^
Its about a lost dog. ^
The fact that he left is sad. ^
The whole idea is great. ^
It is likely to rain. ^
I want them to come here. ^
I do not know her. ^
Try at least once. ^
Learn how to cook. ^
Do you know what to do? ^
They have arrived. ^
I want you to come here. ^
Difficult but we can. ^
For example take this. ^
We agree on this matter. ^
We need to act right now. ^
Stay because its fun. ^
Ill give it to you. ^
In a moment. ^
They traveled to the United States. ^
What will you do? ^
In New York. ^
Walk down the road. ^
I heard that a storm is coming. ^
If they agree. ^
Move as they do. ^
I live in the city. ^
Thanks for this book. ^
The sun shone brightly and it was warm. ^
I would go. ^
Join us as well. ^
Lost but the hope remains. ^
Thats what they said. ^
A few apples fell from the tree. ^
Much of it is new. ^
The cat is under the bed. ^
Leave because the game ended. ^
Choose between the two. ^
Its not a problem. ^
This is part of the process. ^
They went to their home. ^
No one knows. ^
A great idea came to her suddenly. ^
To be or not to be. ^
The government makes laws. ^
We left when the party ended. ^
Walk around the park. ^
They had a plan. ^
She went to his house. ^
He is very kind. ^
In order to go. ^
In our house. ^
All of the cookies were eaten. ^
She smiled and he waved back. ^
He stopped to help. ^
I visited New York. ^
I think it works. ^
Learn to use it. ^
These are the best days of our lives. ^
I want to know more. ^
I hope that this works. ^
It is likely to rain. ^
The United Nations met. ^
It does not fit. ^
Ill give it to you. ^
I have a story to tell. ^
It was such a surprise. ^

And what will you do now? ^

A lot of stars were visible tonight. ^

A new school was built nearby. ^
In an hour. ^

And you can bring a friend. ^
The new plan is better. ^
We were there. ^
Do not go there. ^
You can choose the red shirt or the blue one. ^
Do you have the time? ^
He has a good sense of humor. ^
Is that true? ^

Decide based on facts. ^
Act as an example. ^
There were many stars. ^
The hat sat on his head. ^

Is the door open? ^
It is a cat. ^
First we eat and then we go. ^
We love of our childhood. ^
No one knows. ^
Thank you so much. ^
I need to get milk. ^
She had a very nice smile. ^
The cat and the dog were friends. ^

I think that its true. ^
In his room. ^
In order to go. ^
People who read often learn much. ^
That would be great. ^
I did not think so. ^
Work hard so that you succeed. ^
I thought hard. ^
I visited New York. ^
Would you like to go? ^
I dont like that. ^
She grew up in the city. ^

We are ready. ^
Its all right to ask for help. ^
Do it now. ^
She went to his house. ^
They told stories of their adventures. ^
It happened during the night. ^
I want them to come here. ^
Of course Ill come. ^
Books that are interesting. ^
Its part of a plan. ^
Not only that but more. ^
Choose which is best. ^
He left for his trip. ^
Tomorrow will be better. ^
Remember to look both ways. ^
He was the last to know. ^
Let us go when it stops raining. ^
Take care of your house. ^
Its part of an idea. ^
Wait for the next one. ^
The best of all. ^
He jumped off the dock. ^
There is a lot of noise. ^
Walk around the park. ^
Look at this picture. ^
What do you want? ^
A little sugar sweetens the tea. ^
Do you want to go? ^
The fact that he left is sad. ^
Such as this? ^
He laughed and she joined in. ^
She is tall enough to reach. ^
He loves to make art. ^
In her room. ^
He built his own house. ^
I hope that you come soon. ^
He works for the company. ^
They were late. ^
I wonder what he wants. ^
She goes to work early. ^
They have been here. ^

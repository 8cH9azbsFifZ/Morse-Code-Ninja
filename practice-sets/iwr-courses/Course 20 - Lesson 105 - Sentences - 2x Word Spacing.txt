he ran over my dog.^
i wonder if she knew.^
we will fill the street with people.^
it was all just a game to him.^
it was more than the weight of my horse.^
that is the wonder of it all.^
he also ran.^
what did i miss?^
what is the weight of that plane?^
she said that bed was just the right size.^
go east until you get to a big rock.^
let him play his game.^
that is one possible problem.^
she said that bed was just the right size.^
it is not hot enough yet to turn that snow to water.^
that was a long time ago.^
go as fast as possible^
he will have the last laugh.^
he brought his own bed.^
it was so long ago.^
do they ever laugh?^
that water is too hot.^
he ran over my dog.^
the plane just took off.^
i found a few that are dry enough.^
every point is in the same plane.^
i wonder if it is possible to laugh as you age.^
what is the weight of that plane?^
plane some more off.^
the well has run dry.^
she is at the age when every thing is a wonder.^
it was just to fill the time.^
that was a while ago.^
just let her sit for a minute.^
we had to laugh at the whole thing.^
too much weight will make you slow.^
she was in good shape for the game.^
a check will be fine.^
you had better laugh.^
take a weight off.^
where can i sit?^
this side of the island is too dry.^
the plane just took off.^
why is there snow on my bed?^
that was more than a year ago.^
it was so long ago.^
plane it down some more.^
age before beauty.^
that was a while ago.^
we ran the whole way.^
he will try to snow you.^
perhaps you need to check it again.^
age before beauty.^
page one thousand two hundred and four.^
they all ran down the street together.^
this can not be possible.^
he also ran.^
i will sit here all day if i like.^
it began to take shape in my mind.^
it was a very light snow.^
you will laugh when you hear it.^
i had to miss the game.^
that was a while ago.^
it was hard to miss.^
it was so long ago.^
let him play his game.^
the plane just took off.^
i will wonder about it for the rest of my life.^
why is there snow on my bed?^
do not sit on the bed.^
i found a few that are dry enough.^
where did she sit?^
all that is possible.^
i will have him in shape in no time.^
write me a check for a thousand.^
you had better laugh.^
i said yes a long time ago.^
you are in check.^
i had to check it all again.^
there was not enough wood to heat the room.^
how deep was the snow?^
that is one possible problem.^
but it is a dry heat.^
the answer to your question is yes.^
that was a while ago.^
at what age did i last see you?^
my dog ran over there.^
i will be there in a hot minute.^
write me a check for a thousand.^
plane that door down until it will close.^
i had to miss the game.^
she was in good shape for the game.^
perhaps i will.^
i thought you brought it for me.^
i wonder if she knew.^
take a weight off.^
i will sit here all day if i like.^
what did i miss?^
we ran the whole way.^
age before beauty.^
plane it down some more.^
that was a long time ago.^

what kind of shape is it in?^
it was in the shape of a star.^
what brought about this change of mind?^
that was a while ago.^
it was all just a game to him.^
i ran it dry an hour ago.^
she said that bed was just the right size.^
what brought you here?^
there is no perhaps about it.^
it was more than the weight of my horse.^
that water is too hot.^
it is not hot enough yet to turn that snow to water.^
you had better laugh.^
i will wonder about it for the rest of my life.^
it is a hot game.^
he brought his own bed.^
that is the wonder of it all.^
when did all the wonder go out of it?^
just let her sit for a minute.^
he brought his own bed.^
it was a very light snow.^
that was a long time ago.^
at what age did i last see you?^
fill it up.^
i will wonder about it for the rest of my life.^
she said that bed was just the right size.^
he also ran.^
this side of the island is too dry.^
it was just to fill the time.^
how dry i am.^
there were over ten thousand.^
it was hot in the old town.^
that is the wonder of it all.^
i wonder where she went.^
now is the age of man.^
i wonder if it is possible to laugh as you age.^
it was too long ago to remember.^
what heat did she run in?^
we are all the same age.^
it was all just a game to him.^
we ran the whole way.^
it was at the end of the last age.^
where can i sit?^
it was hard to miss.^
what did i miss?^
perhaps i will.^

you will find it if you go far enough east.^
there was enough of it to fill the field.^
the check light is on.^
did you see the snow fall?^
i had to check it all again.^

dry it off.^
a miss is as good as a mile.^
it is a dry land farm.^
perhaps you need to check it again.^
perhaps i will.^
i will fall down if i dont sit down soon.^
they all ran down the street together.^
it is a hot game.^
i thought you brought it for me.^
at what age did i last see you?^

that was a while ago.^
that was a long time ago.^
the plane just took off.^
take a weight off.^
that was a while ago.^
that mark will tell you how full to fill it.^
we had to laugh at the whole thing.^
what heat did she run in?^
fill it up.^
we ran the whole way.^
now is the age of man.^
when did all the wonder go out of it?^

i will always wonder about that.^
that water is too hot.^
he also ran.^
he brought his own bed.^
i am off to bed.^

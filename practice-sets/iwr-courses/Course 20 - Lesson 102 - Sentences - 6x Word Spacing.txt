i may say yes when i have had a time to think about it.^
let me bring you some hot food.^
you had better laugh.^
a check will be fine.^
perhaps he is the right man for it.^
all that is possible.^
what is possible?^
it was a very light snow.^
what did i miss?^
plane that door down until it will close.^
a check will be fine.^
take a weight off.^
time to start a new game.^
that was more than a year ago.^
it was too long ago to remember.^
what is possible?^
it was too long ago to remember.^
plane some more off.^
he ran over my dog.^
you did not age it long enough.^
why is there snow on my bed?^
a miss is as good as a mile.^

the well has run dry.^
a check will be fine.^
he also ran.^
i said yes a long time ago.^
he ran over my dog.^
there was enough of it to fill the field.^
you had better watch your weight.^
age before beauty.^
i had to check it all again.^
let him play his game.^
you had better laugh.^
there is no way to game it.^
do not sit on the bed.^
we had to laugh at the whole thing.^
let us begin with the possible.^
i will fall down if i dont sit down soon.^
a check will be fine.^
plane that door down until it will close.^

the river is east of here.^
it was hard to miss.^
you will live to a great age.^
that is one possible problem.^
do not sit on the bed.^
i may say yes when i have had a time to think about it.^
did she say yes?^
i wonder where she went.^
there were one or two thousand of them.^
how deep was the snow?^
he had the weight of the world on him.^
the well has run dry.^
but it is a dry heat.^
this side of the island is too dry.^
write me a check for a thousand.^
you had better laugh.^
why is there snow on my bed?^
the answer to your question is yes.^
there were over ten thousand.^
this can not be possible.^
my dog ran over there.^
perhaps i will.^
i may say yes when i have had a time to think about it.^

i will sit here all day if i like.^
i had to miss the game.^
he ran over my dog.^
there is no way to game it.^
it is a dry land farm.^
you will laugh when you hear it.^
that water is too hot.^
there is no perhaps about it.^
there was not enough wood to heat the room.^
it was a very light snow.^
why is there snow on my bed?^
that would be dry weight.^
where did she sit?^

i am off to bed.^
you had better watch your weight.^
the check light is on.^
we will fill the street with people.^

i think i am ready to check out now.^
he brought his own bed.^
we will fill the street with people.^
my dog ran over there.^

he will have the last laugh.^
i will sit here all day if i like.^
that would be dry weight.^
i am off to bed.^
that is the wonder of it all.^
time to start a new game.^
the plane just took off.^
just let her sit for a minute.^
the check light is on.^
i will always wonder about that.^
a miss is as good as a mile.^
did you miss me?^
age before beauty.^
a check will be fine.^
i had to miss the game.^
perhaps he is the right man for it.^
did you miss me?^
it will not take the weight.^
i will fall down if i dont sit down soon.^
fill out this form.^
perhaps you should ask.^
check this out.^
he could not stand the heat.^
i said yes a long time ago.^
i had to miss the game.^
you had better laugh.^
perhaps i will.^
plane it down some more.^
just let her sit for a minute.^

i am off to bed.^
where can i sit?^
did your check go through?^
he will have to sit out the game.^

when did all the wonder go out of it?^
that is one possible problem.^
i will sit here all day if i like.^
i wonder if she knew.^
let me bring it up.^
sit down and keep still.^
take a weight off.^
the plane just took off.^
i will wonder about it for the rest of my life.^
what kind of shape is it in?^
perhaps you should ask.^
dont laugh at me.^
how dry i am.^
i thought you brought it for me.^
i found a few that are dry enough.^
perhaps you need to check it again.^
perhaps it is time to say yes.^
you will find it if you go far enough east.^
when did all the wonder go out of it?^
the answer to your question is yes.^
fill out this form.^
who brought the food?^

it was so long ago.^
that is one possible problem.^
perhaps i will.^
i think i am ready to check out now.^

check this out.^
there was not enough wood to heat the room.^
i wonder if it is possible to laugh as you age.^
go as fast as possible^

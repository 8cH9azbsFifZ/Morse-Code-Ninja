all that is possible.^
it was too long ago to remember.^
i wonder if you will laugh when you hear it.^
i will live to be a thousand.^
i will have him in shape in no time.^
but it is a dry heat.^
perhaps he is the right man for it.^
i ran out of those.^
the check light is on.^
i could bring it.^
they all ran down the street together.^
i may say yes when i have had a time to think about it.^
that was a long time ago.^
did your check go through?^
there were over ten thousand.^
take a weight off.^
this can not be possible.^
it was at the end of the last age.^
there was not enough wood to heat the room.^
that is the wonder of it all.^
it was just to fill the time.^
do not sit on the bed.^
plane some more off.^
i will always wonder about that.^
i will live to be a thousand.^
there were one or two thousand of them.^
what brought about this change of mind?^
you will find it if you go far enough east.^
he will have the last laugh.^
did she say yes?^
we had to laugh at the whole thing.^
i will wonder about it for the rest of my life.^
there is no perhaps about it.^
what kind of shape is it in?^
what is the weight of that plane?^
this is a dry town.^
it was just to fill the time.^
there was not enough wood to heat the room.^
he had the weight of the world on him.^
i had to miss the game.^

you are in check.^
that is the wonder of it all.^
i said yes a long time ago.^
it is a dry land farm.^
i will sit here all day if i like.^
the check light is on.^
this can not be possible.^
it was more than the weight of my horse.^
will this snow last all day?^
it is a dry land farm.^
she ran a strong first mile.^
i had to miss the game.^
it was just to fill the time.^
too much weight will make you slow.^
we ran the whole way.^
fill it up.^
let him play his game.^
dont laugh at me.^

it is on the east side of the mountain.^
who brought the food?^
dont laugh at me.^
it is on the east side of the mountain.^
that would be dry weight.^
do they ever laugh?^
we had to laugh at the whole thing.^
that was a long time ago.^
my dog ran over there.^
that is one possible problem.^
write me a check for a thousand.^
he had the weight of the world on him.^
i wonder where she went.^
bring out the best.^
that would be dry weight.^
this can not be possible.^
that water is too hot.^

i will live to be a thousand.^
you will laugh when you hear it.^
time to start a new game.^
it was hot in the old town.^
bring on the heat.^
when did all the wonder go out of it?^
there is no way to game it.^
perhaps you should ask.^
it was too long ago to remember.^
that was a while ago.^
he ran over my dog.^
what heat did she run in?^
i had to check it all again.^
perhaps i will.^
it was so long ago.^
the plane just took off.^
dont laugh at me.^
at what age did i last see you?^
there was enough of it to fill the field.^
what is possible?^
it was at the end of the last age.^
perhaps you should ask.^
dry it off.^

i could bring it.^
she is at the age when every thing is a wonder.^
she went back east.^
i had more than a hundred of those just a minute ago.^
will this snow last all day?^
every point is in the same plane.^

she ran a strong first mile.^
do not sit on the bed.^
she ran a strong first mile.^

you had better laugh.^
where did she sit?^
go as fast as possible^
it is not hot enough yet to turn that snow to water.^
she is at the age when every thing is a wonder.^
a miss is as good as a mile.^

he had the weight of the world on him.^
a check will be fine.^
what did i miss?^
where can i sit?^
there were over ten thousand.^
she ran a strong first mile.^
go as fast as possible^
perhaps i will.^
it is a dry land farm.^
the plane just took off.^

Let me go back.
For once you are right.
They never come back.
He said at last.
This is my country.
Is he a real father?
But it was very late.
Just cut it out.
To the left.
Where is the river?
We may be too late.
Are we late?
And what did you do with that letter?
Who said four?
Say good night.
So take care of me.
Here is the paper.
What was left of him?
Why, it was one of his own men.
First turn to the left.
But are you sure of that?
Open the door.
Do you want to cross?
And why should they?
Now you must eat.
But then it will be too late.
He is my friend.
Are we too late?
She must have a hard time with him.
Who should it be?
He may come close.
They always know.
By and by he got it.
Is it in the city?
What did he answer?
Now or never.
But she saw no one?
She is my friend.
Stop, let me show you the way.
You took it.
You should take me there one day.
Let them have it.
Sure of what?
Go back and keep an eye on the children.
Now let me have it.
Why, is it late?
And who is this friend?
And he left the room.
And there are four of you?
We got to let that go.
Stop, said he.
What should he say?
He might still be up.
It would seem so.
Dont tell me.
There is only food for one.
Take care of him.
They dont know their own country.
How many children?
He has been been found.
He is always at it.
Who took him out of it?
Have you got it?
Come, let us be men.
Let us go in.
One was on a white horse.
But then you would be close to the sea?
But what is it, and where is it to be found?
Who did you learn that from?
You are sure he will keep his word with me?
What was it that you thought?
You might want it.
But why dont you want to take it?
That is the idea.
Just cut it out, will you?
Where has she run off to?
Who was the letter from?
It must be in her own house.
Why, dont you hear it?
But it would be in the paper.
He had two left feet.
But now it is too late.
It is always so.
She came over last night.
Let us start, then.
Can you stand?
And she left the room.
Why do you stop here?
And your children?
Why should they?
Always the same with you people.
Let me have a word with you.
What do you hear?
And now, good night.
But watch over him.
Ask one of those men.
Think of my father.
We might learn a thing or two.
Dont you want any?
She saw no one?
It was the last day of the year.
It was his own room.
But you must never tell.
Do you know where he is?
What a night it has been.
The sun had set long since.
Our own people must come first.
The other night she left.
It is so very kind of you both.
Still, you never know.
What was the name of the man who took it?
So, once more, good night.
Good night again.
Stop and think.
So they got out and went in.
Take these, he said, and study them well.
We must go at once.
Good for the country.
That night we were just in time.
Few had found it.
Well, run back to her.
How many are left?
Let me see him at once.
We are together.
It is a long story.
Where could you keep it?
This is real.
What did you hear?
It is from your father.
We should look at this.
No, said her father.
You are sure of that?
Come eat with me.
Tell me more.
Which story was it?
Do you know what he did last night?
It will be too late.
What did he say in the letter?
It was the first thing he thought of.
Why is he cross with me?
Dont you see that?
They came over last night.
See him grow up.
She got up.
Do you know how he made his mark?
How did it begin?
What is life to you?
If you know, why dont you tell?
Come over in the sun.
It was white.
Then, good night.
She is still here?
No, never.
So it always was.
Let him grow up with you.
They never did it again.
Dont move, he said.
He saw his men draw back.
You found him?
Here he is at last.
Any book will tell you that.
Call the next one.
We never thought of that.
There was no letter for me.
He came at once.
Where is this city?
Are you my friend?
You have a car?
Keep to the right.
Did you see his eye?
We found it.
Why dont you want to go?
How could you begin?
No one would have thought the end was so near.
Have you found it?
This is what began it all.
It is well thought of.
Tell us a story.
Do you have the letter?
Life is all right.
Let me get to work.
Let me in.
Well, what next?
It was then time to start.
My father is right.
She came in just now by the back door.
He had only one night more to live.
Music is a good thing.
Only, dont look back.
Point it at his horse.
How much have you got?
They may tell us to open it.
Cut your hand open?
But it is all all too late now.
Off with his head.
No, stop.
You got me?
What do you think when you hear music?
Let me say one thing.
Do you often come back?
Well, here we are at last, said one of them.
Come at once.
Do you hear me?
But what did you hear?
Why should this be so?
What is your real name?
What do you think of the music?
Let me see it.
When did you begin?
There were few near me.
Keep to the left.
Let me get on with my work.
But let us walk.
Well, let us be sure of that.
But take care.
Do we stop here?
You must walk.
At last we have a man.
Are you sure?
Here is the letter.
Just set still and take it like a man.
Just a few.
No, dont.
Let her go.
How would they stop it?
Let me see him.
And what did you learn from him?
But they may still come here.
Go to your father.
And this food?
Watch over him.
You will answer for it.
But it is the same with any life.
Let me out.
There, do you hear?
Who let you in?
You know all the men from this part of the country.
Do you want some more to eat?
Let me know at once when you will start.
Which end is his head?
This took place at his house, in his room.
Are you sure of it?
Let me see her.
Give me the letter.
No, why should he?
Never see him again.
Dont say that to me.
Have you never been there?
At this time of my life, no.
There are only four of us.
Is there any answer?
We should ask him.
But hard to tell.
Dont you like it?
Dont you think so?
There was no answer.
What country does he come from?
Good night, friend.
It might help.
He is my father.
Who can answer for that?
what river is it?
A call for help, you thought?
Let us cross over.
No, that can never be.
What a start that was.
Write an answer.
He is at sea.
Have you got that?
Come let us see them.
They are hard at it.
Here we see the boy at school.
Both of us.
And she left the room.
This took him some time.
And now let us go home.
Well, read the letter again.
He then said, It is time to start.
You must never tell.
it took all that time to come over the water.
Is it far?
She saw it.
The children will live just the same.
It was very hard.
Off with her head.
Who found them out?
So he began to help.
Do you have a car?
Have you been at sea?
Here is the book.
It is music.
No, said the Tree.
Can you hear me?
Will you never learn?
We got under way at last.
You must eat now.
We were together.
They are always the same.
It was like new life to him.
Let me be and let me live.
Let us go back.
Tell her to begin.
Keep watch all night.
Do you hear that?
And then we may begin.
Let me hear your story.
You are sure of it?
A second man got up and went out.
Does he never go out?
These were the first people we saw.
You saw him?
We dont see it like that.
That was the first night.
Who could have thought it?
And then they began to fish.
You are right, father.
Let him follow me.
Let me look.
She might be at his house.
We must begin again.
Then let me have a word with you.
At four, she said.
You must study.
Watch him, he said.
We got one and they got one.
Where have you been this long while?
He could run no more.
Is my father here?
Cut him down.
But you got to play music for them.
Let me hear what it is.
We are very far from that.
One of us will be here all night.
In the country?
They dont care.
How could you let him go so far?
Is that far?
What would you have me do with my life?
Let me go to the door.
One never has too much.
One night more and he would be on his way.
Let him answer us.
It is open?
Why dont you play?
She never came back.
Always the same, year after year.
Was you in my room?
Look at his face.
He had no idea how long he had been there.
Right here it began.
Come here, my friend.
Take care.
There to the left.
He has children of his own.

im going to go out on a limb: 383
there was no way i was going to: 383
the more i think about it the more: 380
beauty is in the eye of the beholder: 376
for the first time in my life i: 371
the more i thought about it the more: 370

the first thing we need to do is: 359
there are a lot of people out there: 356
to make it as easy as possible for: 352
ive said it before and ill say it: 351
wake up in the middle of the night: 349
in the first six months of this year: 343
i would like to take this opportunity to: 343
and the rest as they say is history: 332
was the straw that broke the camels back: 332
can you tell us a little bit about: 325
but at the end of the day its: 320
go down in history as one of the: 318
for the first time in the history of: 316
the land of the free and the home: 313
i hope you can see your way clear: 312
if youre new here you may want to: 310
on the one hand and on the other: 306
but at the end of the day i: 306
to come to terms with the fact that: 305
the gap between the rich and the poor: 302
this is the first in a series of: 294
to give him the benefit of the doubt: 293
if you are interested in learning more about: 290
a force to be reckoned with in the: 290
the first thing you need to do is: 288
of the people by the people and for: 279
i think it is fair to say that: 278
spend the rest of his life in prison: 277
no deal is better than a bad deal: 270
out of the corner of my eye i: 269
one of the best if not the best: 268
in the oval office of the white house: 267
in the first three months of this year: 265
the same can not be said for the: 264
right of the people to keep and bear: 259
this is a step in the right direction: 259
what to do and what not to do: 257
was the best thing that ever happened to: 256
let me know if you have any questions: 255
in what can only be described as a: 254
and let the chips fall where they may: 253
what difference at this point does it make: 251
so what does this have to do with: 247
caught between a rock and a hard place: 246
i had no idea what i was doing: 245
you may pay the cost if you do: 242
the president of the united states of america: 240
there are a lot of people who are: 240
at all hours of the day and night: 239
to take the law into their own hands: 238
i dont know what im going to do: 237
how i learned to stop worrying and love: 236
to the left and to the right of: 236
stuck between a rock and a hard place: 236
but it doesnt have to be that way: 234
when was the last time you saw a: 231
the road to hell is paved with good: 230
have something to do with the fact that: 229
ask not what your country can do for: 222
is in the final year of his contract: 221
is greater than the sum of its parts: 221
the whole truth and nothing but the truth: 220
the fact of the matter is that the: 219
there is no limit to the number of: 215
i cant think of a better way to: 213
it is only a matter of time before: 213
the first thing that comes to mind is: 211
the only way to do that is to: 211
this is why we cant have nice things: 211
we will do everything in our power to: 209
and theres nothing you can do about it: 209
day of christmas my true love gave to: 206
do unto others as you would have them: 203
a lot of that has to do with: 203
according to a person with knowledge of the: 200
i hate to break it to you but: 200
it will be interesting to see if the: 196
it would be more accurate to say that: 194
and dont even get me started on the: 193
the ball in the back of the net: 193
is as good a time as any to: 192
i would go so far as to say: 190
be the next president of the united states: 190
ways you can enter to increase your chances: 188
were going to do everything we can to: 188
of the people by the people for the: 187
do not necessarily reflect the views of the: 186
out with the old in with the new: 184
to pull the united states out of the: 182
which of the following is a type of: 180
we can not rule out the possibility that: 178
what has come to be known as the: 178
it remains to be seen whether or not: 177
the long and short of it is that: 174
but nothing could be further from the truth: 173
for as long as i can remember i: 173
there is an argument to be made that: 168
you dont have to take my word for: 167
it is with a heavy heart that i: 166
end of the world as we know it: 165
a drop in the bucket compared to the: 164
can count on one hand the number of: 163
one of the richest men in the world: 162
is a step in the right direction but: 161
has been going on for a long time: 161
be the change we wish to see in: 161
one of these things is not like the: 157
stop me if youve heard this one before: 157
going to go out on a limb and: 157
we need all the help we can get: 156
so long and thanks for all the fish: 156
just the latest in a long line of: 156
is the first of its kind in the: 156
there are a number of reasons for this: 155
im going to do everything i can to: 154
the world would be a better place if: 153
how did you come up with the idea: 152
can mean the difference between life and death: 152
the light at the end of the tunnel: 152
much like rumors nothing is certain until its: 150
to have their cake and eat it too: 148
have to go all the way back to: 148
i cant tell you how many times i: 147
is considered to be one of the most: 147
for reasons that have nothing to do with: 146
the list goes on and on and on: 145
but that was then and this is now: 145
there is no reason to believe that the: 144
what to do and how to do it: 144
became the first country in the world to: 144
or how i learned to stop worrying and: 144
the best way to do that is to: 142
its the most wonderful time of the year: 141
could not have come at a worse time: 140
you know as well as i do that: 140
what are we going to do about it: 140
in the same place at the same time: 138
it was the best of times it was: 137
those who can not remember the past are: 137
has been a thorn in the side of: 136
the best thing to do would be to: 136
because it was the right thing to do: 136
first they ignore you then they laugh at: 135
always look on the bright side of life: 134
who was not involved in the new study: 133
put their lives on the line every day: 132
be the first of its kind in the: 131
i think it is safe to say that: 131
expected to be completed by the end of: 130
could not have come at a better time: 129
i had no idea what was going on: 129
i guess what im trying to say is: 128
this is due to the fact that the: 127
for every action there is an equal and: 126
still have a lot of work to do: 126
there was a time not so long ago: 125
now is as good a time as any: 123
our thoughts and prayers go out to the: 122
take a step back and look at the: 122
the only thing we have to fear is: 121
which is more than can be said for: 121
quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog: 120
to see what all the fuss is about: 119
i can not for the life of me: 118
to win the hearts and minds of the: 117
it is also important to note that the: 117
to the best of our knowledge this is: 117
would go on to become one of the: 116
to see what all the fuss was about: 116
in the first six months of the year: 115
the first time something like this has happened: 114
with the way things are going in the: 113
here is a list of some of the: 113
is a solution in search of a problem: 112
there is no right or wrong way to: 112
but did not receive a response in time: 112
if you want to know more about the: 111
is a slap in the face to the: 111
is just the latest in a series of: 111
to get out of bed in the morning: 110
woke up in the middle of the night: 110
i like to think of myself as a: 109
for god so loved the world that he: 109
it took me a while to figure out: 109
he is a good guy i hope you: 109
to be on the right side of history: 108
but at the end of the day the: 108

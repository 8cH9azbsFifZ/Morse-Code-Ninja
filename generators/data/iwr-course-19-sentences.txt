That is a whole lot of nothing.
We will stay for the full course.
Stay off the street.
Only the surface of the object is blue.
They will not force me to decide.
The water is only an inch deep.
Test it before you call it a fact.
This wheel is out of round.
You will feel the full force of it.
The moon was not yet full.
No man is an island.
Stay a foot from the street.
We were too busy to test that.
We have a record of the test.
Blue moon was the name of our boat.
We have a lot in common.
The street was made of gold.
It is a simple fact of life.
Where will this street take me?
Give them an inch and they will take a mile.
That lot is too small.
There is nothing more I can do.
Of course you can stay.
Just wheel me out of here.
The pattern is full.
I will if you force me.
Am I blue?
He did not object.
Help me decide.
It was all just on the surface.
Do you think it is deep?
The moon will set soon.
They put an island in the center of the street.
Is your foot hot?
Are we there yet?
Do not tell me you were too busy.
I will pass any test.
Did you happen to record the call?
It was only a paper boat.
You know how common they are.
Go for the gold.
That does not mean it is a fact.
To state that it is a fact does not make it so.
That is what they say on the street.
He had to stop just an inch from the end.
You will need a lot more.
Tell that lot to keep still.
Nothing from nothing is nothing.
What will the first course be?
You must follow the same course.
How long can you stay?
I will not stay there.
That was just one turn of the wheel.
He is just full of it.
The people will come out in force.
Did you see him turn blue?
You will not object to this.
The king will decide.
They came to the surface together.
You did not go deep enough.
Did he just moon me?
She is on the other side of the island.
They all went on foot.
He has yet to complete the first five.
Not half as busy as I am.
The test did not go well.
That is a record for them.
Dont rock the boat.
It is common for young children.
Give him a gold star.
Her word is as good as gold.
How much gold does one person need?
That fish is not gold.
That is the plain fact of it.
I would walk down this street every day.
I saw him run down that street.
The town has only one street.
This was a great street to live on.
One inch is not room enough.
Just one little inch more.
Do not move an inch.
There was only an inch between them.
That was his lot in life.
That lot is too close to the street.
Take an example from that lot.
Is that lot?
I know this lot is good.
You stand for nothing.
Nothing could be more simple.
The fire left me with nothing.
There is nothing to cover it with.
The note said nothing about it.
I thought nothing of it.
The river went back to the old course.
She came to find it during a life long course of study.
There was very little interest in the course.
This is but one course in a very long list.
His course is as good as any.
I will go stay on the farm.
Do you mind if I stay a minute?
Give me a hand.
This will stay between you and me.
That wheel will not work.
I found it in the wheel well.
Is it too full?
I thought it was full.
The box was full of fish.
He gave full measure.
He did not give you the full story.
I will never feel full again.
Order the full course.
I could still force you.
The unit is at full force.
Do not force it.
It was only a show of force.
There is no blue food.
My old dog blue.
That was the object of my plan.
Why dont you object?
The noun is the object in that sentence.
Now is the time to decide.
I can not decide.
What did you decide to do?
It was just under the surface.
The whole surface was blue.
That was deep.
How deep would you like to go?
He has a very deep voice.
The moon is behind that tree.
What kind of name is moon unit.
The moon is half full.
The island was set in a deep blue sea.
That side of the island is too far from here.
Take your foot out of that box.
The left foot is not as big as the right.
He left it at the foot of the mountain.
He has yet to cross that line.
Is it time to go yet?
I have yet to hear your answer.
Just get busy.
She is busy with her own story.
Who can say how busy it will get?
Did I pass the test?
This is a test of how well you can govern.
Turn the record over.
Make a record of it.
Did you record that song?
He took the slow boat home.
That is a picture of my old boat.
It is all for the common good.
Blue is a very common color.
Did you notice what they have in common?
How will we move all that gold.
They gave him a gold watch.

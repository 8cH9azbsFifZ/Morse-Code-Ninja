She had the top farm in the whole state.
I knew he would pass on that product.
I told him the short piece was black.
I think that south wind will keep the fire back.
Did you complete the problem in class?
What will happen if I dont answer the question?
The ship was only half complete.
I will look under every rock.
Give me an example of a numeral.
It could happen.
The rock was half black.
Most of the state was under water.
She only knew a piece of the problem.
You will pass a big farm.
The whole top of the ship was on fire.
Look for the rock about half a mile to the south.
That is the area where the class came up short.
I told you he knew what a numeral is.
Is that black enough for you?
State the question again.
This is the top product.
That took the wind out of him.
Make it a short one.
Add the numeral two to the list.
He was in a bad state.
She did not state the problem well.
The wind is too light.
His was a class act.
It will happen some day.
He began to question the children.
Tell me if you happen to see her.
You can ship the product any time.
That area is hard to cross.
Only half of them knew the answer.
He was between a rock and a hard place.
It could go under any day.
I told you to fire him.
The mountain is south of the river.
Play or pass.
He has a farm in the city.
That book is at the top of my list.
He had a whole one.
Just cut it in half.
What is your area of study?
That is the mother ship.
The house is complete.
Do not let it happen again.
Do you have a question for me?
I can hear the wind through the door.
His was the first class to leave.
You can not just use any numeral you want.
The show was short a song or two.
That was a very black day for us all.
Move the product a little to the right.
He never said what state he came from.
I can state it in one sentence.
If this one is black then that one must be red.
Great product you have there.
Which is the short way?
Place the numeral next to the number.
Which class does this go in?
It may wind up too long.
I knew that question would be a problem.
Just to show the ease with which it could happen.
It took way to long to complete.
She will direct the state of the ship.
Measure the area under the rock.
I could do that with half as much.
Give me a piece of the rock.
Pass me a piece of fish.
I need a piece of paper.
Which piece will he take?
Who knew you told me?
A horse is also a farm animal.
He got to the top first.
Do not top off.
The whole top came off.
He did not tell the whole story.
She knew it the whole time.
That is the whole problem.
The whole thing went south.
I question the whole thing.
I cover the whole state.
What will you call your product?
It is all there in black and white.
It will land just short of the line.
Let me wind this up.
To be or not to be is a question.
You can make it happen.
It is complete enough.
It will ship well.
You must all leave the area.
I want the big half.
They could rock the place.
Go get under that tree.
You need to start a fire.
I live in south end.
It is a problem we all face.
That is just one piece of the problem.
You should have told me.
You knew it would not pass.
I had to farm it out.
She got the top mark.

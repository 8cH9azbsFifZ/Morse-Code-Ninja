Your father can stand on his head.
Your father is as old as the earth.
You should head out to the country.
This page should stand out.
You need to find your own answer.
He found the answer at school.
You can grow your own food.
If you study you will grow.
You thought you are too old but you can still learn.
He found that plant over by the school.
To keep the sun off the food you must cover it.
I thought there were four.
Let us keep an eye on him.
One should never try to keep it for more that a day.
Take a picture of the earth.
The boy is father to the man.
Some people may head down to the water
I will not stand for it.
You need to own it.
He will answer if you page him.
Ask not what your country can do for you.
He should have found it by now.
That is all the answer you will get.
What kind of school is that?
It will never grow old.
I would study if I had the time.
He will never learn.
He went under cover.
Where is the plant?
There is too much food here.
What time will the sun set?
We need four more.
He never thought it through.
You will find that sentence on page three.
I should head over to the school.
He found it in back of the house.
I still want to go to the country.
I thought she should study it.
That was not a great answer.
A little water should make it grow.
Come help me plant this thing.
The cover came off.
That will be food for thought.
Too much sun can make you hot.
We also play four on four.
If I let you keep it you will have to take it for good.
The sun was in my eye.
We will never get there like this.
He should never have let you keep it.
He made the earth stand still.
My father made me work for it.
His mother and father were just here.
Tell them to head over here when they are through.
That is line four.
This is my kind of country.
He will make his own place.
He found that thing under the cover.
I will get you after school.
What do we need to make the country grow?
Too bad we have to study.
We still need to learn how to grow it.
He will know when it is time to plant.
Show me how to take off the cover.
He said the food was too hot.
Let us follow the sun.
Do the four of them look as bad as these three?
I do not even like the thought of it.
Must you keep the light on all day?
Does the eye look too small?
Look me in the eye.
You never can tell.
He had to stand there all day
We will not stand for it any more.
We went there on earth day.
Her father has his own show.
I have to head off now.
I could only read one page at a time.
You should find a name for it.
He was a country boy.
I only found a little of it.
That is the only answer you will get.
You give your school a bad name.
It does not grow by the water.
You can study it for a long time and still not get it.
He had to learn each one.
Do keep an eye on it.
I think I will plant it here.
Does it have some form of a cover?
What kind of food do you like?
The sun will be out all day.
He came by at four.
She thought she should try again.
Just let him think he did well.
Keep as much of it as you can.
We will never see eye to eye.
You will need to move the earth.
Will you go find your father?
Is your father the head of the house?
I want you to stand right by my side.
Do it your own self.
And that was only the first page.
I think I should go.
This in my country.
He never found the right sound.
This could be the answer.
We will build the new school right here.
Grow up and act like a man.
She is in the study.
They will still be here when you go.
You have very little time to learn the part.
She will take the plant home.
Will is the cover?
Did you find any food?
This will only let a little sun through.
Say the first word on line four.
I never said I could do it.
I thought you said you could do it.
Keep an eye on him.

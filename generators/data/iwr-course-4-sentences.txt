As long as you make no sound.
Call first if you would like to come over.
Call me at this number.
Call me first.
Can you make a thing like this?
Can you make this sound?
Can you see how long these are?
Can you use these?
Come and see me.
Come over here.
Could I see him?
Could you get me some water?
Could you go and make me some?
Could you look at me?
Could you make him go over there?
Could you make my thing look like his?
Did you see him over there?
Did you see that look he had?
Do not use the water from over there.
Do you see her over by the water?
Go and get two of them.
Go over the water.
Go over there and make him see.
Have some water.
He could use these.
He had a day or more to do it.
He has a bad look about him.
He has more than that.
He has no more than most.
He has to look at it all day.
He was the first one in the water.
He will get more than two.
How could you see him?
How long can this day go on?
How long did this go on?
How long will this day go on?
How long will this go on?
How many of these did you make?
I can go as long as he can.
I can make a number of them.
I could go for most of the day.
I could have said more than that.
I could look at the two of them all day.
I could tell you a thing or two about him.
I could use some water.
I have no time for you.
I know a thing or two about him.
I know we can make it.
I know who that is.
I long to see that day.
I look at it day by day.
I see two of them.
I will be here most of the day.
I will get a number of them.
I will make him see a thing or two.
I will make the most of my day.
If i see him I will tell him he has to go.
If you come I will go.
If you make it they will come.
In a day or two he will look like me.
Look and see if he has it.
Look at him.
Look at how many he has.
Make him go.
Make him see who he is.
Make it as long as this.
Make my day.
Make no sound.
Make no sound if you see him.
Make one for me.
Make one like this.
Make one more of these.
Make two of these.
Most of them are over there.
Most of them look like him.
Most of them make no sound.
Most of these are his.
My number is up.
My time is over.
No sound could be so long as to make him look up.
She can tell you more than I can.
She has more time than you.
She has the look.
She has to see these.
She has two more than you.
She was the first one to get here.
So this is how you make these.
That is more than I would like to see.
That is the sound of water.
That was the first sound he could make.
That was the number.
The day is over.
The number one would go first.
The two of them could go a long way.
The water will go over here.
Then I will write two a day.
There are no more.
There is more in here than there is in there.
There is no more in here than there was the other day.
These are so hot.
These make no sound.
These two are all we have.
These two are his.
They make this thing so long that you can not see it all.
This could go a long way.
This is as long as it can get.
This is day two.
This is more than that.
This is the first day.
Two is more than one.
Two is the most you can get.
We will be there when you come over.
Where did that sound come from?
Who could be so bad?
Who could make all of these in one day?
Who could make that sound?
Who did that?
Who do you see?
Who has the number one?
Who is first?
Who is that over there by the water?
Who said that?
Who was that?
Who was the first to get here?
Who would you call other than her?
You can come and go as you like.
You can look all day but you will not see him.
You can see that he has two of them.
You can tell him who you are when you call.
You could come over here.
You could go all day and not see him more than a time or two.
You could go over there.
You make the day so long.

Is it true they only have king size?
I have heard that this is the best hour.
You had better reach one hundred during the first hour.
Just remember that I am as fast as he is.
Step over here and hold this.
Hold the high ground.
Go west young man.
It is too early to travel.
It was just self interest.
Can you reach it?
It will take five and a half.
There are six at the table.
I will not listen to him sing that again.
I will need six large.
Make it fast.
He who would be king.
This is the best size.
I have heard better.
I got here an hour early.
Is that his true interest?
You do not eat during a fast.
I can remember more that a hundred.
I am the best man.
Step up to the table.
He was an early hold out.
That is not true west.
The very ground you walk on.
That is too much interest.
They will reach the mark together.
That is one fast dog.
I get five again.
Let them sing.
Listen to that bird.
You will find it on page six.
We will table that for now.
You could travel the whole country and never find a better one.
Do not move your king.
They had to down size.
I think you heard me.
Show me your best move.
An hour should be enough.
It was better last year.
The one true thing.
It was open during the whole class.
He had a hundred or more.
Tell me if I am about to reach the end.
I dont remember the size.
That was the next step.
I got a hold of one early.
A way out west they have a name for rain and wind and fire.
It was all over the ground.
I saw the interest in his eye.
It is always just out of reach.
His watch was fast.
There were five or six of them.
If you know it just sing out.
If you stop to listen to him we will never get a table.
I like to travel by ship.
I do it all for king and country.
I remember I heard him say it was for the best.
It is so hot at that hour.
My friend took the better room.
Only five or six out of a hundred.
It came true this year.
They are not open during the day.
You know who I am.
Am I the one you want?
She may start to remember.
Do not step on it.
Get there early.
Hold out your hand.
He has a house in the west end.
We need to take the high ground.
He might tell you if you show a little interest.
Walk west until you reach the tree.
It was a five act show.
It all went by so fast.
My mother would sing that to me.
Just be still and listen.
I would like a table for three.
She will be six this year.
He is too old to travel much.
The travel size is too small.
He will be the next king.
Will they reach her in time?
Best to carry it by hand.
You had better be right.
It was all too true.
It began during the school year.
It took a hundred men to stop it.
What did you say I am?
Do you remember that old man we saw?
Do not take one more step.
The early bird will get it.
You may live if you can just hold fast.
The sun was low in the west.
You have to ground it.
The idea does not interest me.
Will they reach him in time?
Table six is open.
You must travel to the north country.
It had better be true if you want me to tell the king.
She heard it during the first hour.
Be true to your school.
He is down by more that a hundred.
So you think I am he?
Will they remember I was here?
Watch your step.
I thought I was early.
Dont let it hold you back.
Many of them went west.
He is still above ground.
We could ask for more interest.
I will eat when we reach base.
I do not eat fast food.
I could hear him five by five.
I will listen if you will sing me an old song.
Leave it on the table.
She said she saw six.
We will travel the country until we see it all.

I wonder if it is possible to laugh as you age.
I ran it dry an hour ago.
What is the weight of that plane?
Write me a check for a thousand.
She was in good shape for the game.
Perhaps it is time to say yes.
Bring on the heat.
It is not hot enough yet to turn that snow to water.
What did I miss?
Do not sit on the bed.
I thought you brought it for me.
Fill it up.
She went back east.
That would be dry weight.
All that is possible.
Plane that door down until it will close.
We are all the same age.
Dry it off.
I will always wonder about that.
You will laugh when you hear it.
There were over ten thousand.
That was a long time ago.
He also ran.
The check light is on.
It was all just a game to him.
The answer to your question is yes.
What kind of shape is it in?
That water is too hot.
Did you miss me?
Who brought the food?
He could not stand the heat.
He will try to snow you.
I am off to bed.
I could bring it.
Where did she sit?
Perhaps I will.
There is only enough to fill one of them.
The river is east of here.
It will not take the weight.
What is possible?
Plane some more off.
You will live to a great age.
This side of the island is too dry.
I wonder where she went.
Dont laugh at me.
I will live to be a thousand.
It was so long ago.
I ran out of those.
Check this out.
Time to start a new game.
It began to take shape in my mind.
I said yes a long time ago.
A miss is as good as a mile.
What brought you here?
What heat did she run in?
Will this snow last all day?
How deep was the snow?
Why is there snow on my bed?
Let me bring it up.
Sit down and keep still.
Perhaps he is the right man for it.
We will fill the street with people.
It is on the east side of the mountain.
It was more than the weight of my horse.
This can not be possible.
Every point is in the same plane.
You did not age it long enough.
I found a few that are dry enough.
When did all the wonder go out of it?
We had to laugh at the whole thing.
Page one thousand two hundred and four.
That was a while ago.
We ran the whole way.
I had to check it all again.
Who thought of this game?
It was in the shape of a star.
I may say yes when I have had a time to think about it.
It was hot in the old town.
It was hard to miss.
What brought about this change of mind?
There was not enough wood to heat the room.
Did you see the snow fall?
She said that bed was just the right size.
Bring out the best.
I will sit here all day if I like.
Perhaps you should ask.
Fill out this form.
Go east until you get to a big rock.
Take a weight off.
Too much weight will make you slow.
You had better watch your weight.
He had the weight of the world on him.
You will find it if you go far enough east.
That mark will tell you how full to fill it.
It was just to fill the time.
There was enough of it to fill the field.
There is no perhaps about it.
Perhaps you need to check it again.
Where can I sit?
I will fall down if i dont sit down soon.
Just let her sit for a minute.
Let me bring you some hot food.
He brought his own bed.
It was a very light snow.
But it is a dry heat.
I had to miss the game.
I will be there in a hot minute.
Did she say yes?
I will have him in shape in no time.
Let him play his game.
There is no way to game it.
It is a hot game.
He will have to sit out the game.
A check will be fine.
Did your check go through?
You are in check.
I think I am ready to check out now.
She ran a strong first mile.
He ran over my dog.
My dog ran over there.
They all ran down the street together.
I had more than a hundred of those just a minute ago.
That was more than a year ago.
It was too long ago to remember.
There were one or two thousand of them.
You had better laugh.
Do they ever laugh?
He will have the last laugh.
I wonder if she knew.
That is the wonder of it all.
I will wonder about it for the rest of my life.
The well has run dry.
This is a dry town.
How dry I am.
She is at the age when every thing is a wonder.
I wonder if you will laugh when you hear it.
It is a dry land farm.
Now is the age of man.
It was at the end of the last age.
Age before beauty.
At what age did I last see you?
Plane it down some more.
Dont you know how to use a plane?
The plane just took off.
That is one possible problem.
Go as fast as possible
Let us begin with the possible.

Only a few children seem to be that open.
We got to the next stop together.
Walk next to the white line.
You should begin with the first example.
We saw the ease they both had with the music.
Those two always mark the paper with the letter a.
Walk next to the river for a mile or so.
Do not stop until the light is off.
There are too few.
It is the white house with the door open.
Ease up to the stop.
We have been together often.
You may begin.
He is father to both of those children.
The time change got to him.
I want to make an example.
I had to walk more than a mile.
Ask her how to ease him through.
I always found that paper to be too white.
How often should we change the paper?
Let the music begin.
Both of those men will get a bad mark.
He found the answer in a book.
Give her the letter.
Follow the river a mile or so.
I will go until I get there.
Go until you get to the four mile mark.
Ease the door open.
She had to stop before she got to the end.
He came to a stop next to that big round white thing.
Give the children some paper.
I think you should begin at the end.
I could never walk that far.
Just set a good example.
I want to begin and end at the same place.
I do not go home often.
I think they will always take you back.
The sound of the water is like music.
I will take some of these and some of those.
I like both of them.
Who put this mark here?
This is the book I want to read
Look for the white mark.
Take this letter to your mother.
Just keep that door open until I get there.
I would walk a mile for a little help.
Does a river run through it?
There was a river of light about it.
I will run that river some other day.
I see that only a few of them have come.
See if this will stop him.
He has been very open to the thought.
So it may seem.
Do not put those two together.
I will not go until next year.
They have the mark of the white hand.
Let the little children go over there.
Does his name begin with the letter a?
I have got to get me one of these.
Take a long walk down to the water.
That was a bad example.
Do you see the ease with which he does it?
You will not paper this over.
The answer may often be found if you only look.
I will be right this time.
Do not change the music.
Set three of those over there.
Have they both been bad?
Put a mark in the book where you stop.
You will write that letter until you learn.
It is only a mile from here to there.
The children have made a little river back there.
I could take a few of them.
This will put a stop to it.
He does not seem open to it.
We must act together.
This will be the next big thing.
When he saw it he went white.
Take your children home.
It is time to begin.
He got both the letter and the book.
You can learn to walk if you keep at it.
Make an example of him.
She got her picture in the paper again.
Come back often.
I always know.
I can always write more music.
See if you can follow those men.
Run this line through both of them.
This mark was made by me.
Take them in and book them.
Who would write such a letter?
Cover the food until we need it.
That was more than a country mile.
He just said that the river was over there.
They come back a few at a time.
He did even not stop to open the door.
It would seem they got together some where.
Look at that next one.
That river has too much white water.
Do you know where your children are?
I begin to see your point.
His get up and go just got up and went.
You have got to walk the walk.
His is a hard example to follow.
You will learn to do it with ease.
I often read that paper at home.
I will walk out if you play that kind of music.
Those were all we had.
I have been on both the good and the bad side.
Mark him well.
We all had to read this book in school.
This letter is far too long.
Dont play with it until I ask your father.
There is more than a mile between us.
You must first cross this river.

People may have been on his side.
Did you find any new work down there?
Now I can take part of that.
Place it in the little round can of water.
You made me take it back.
Live a little.
You only live one day at a time.
You can take it back after a year.
The little round man came to the show every day.
Write it down.
Find me some new people.
Been down so long it will look like up to me.
I work part time now.
I will look for it after we get back.
I like the round one.
That place is bad.
I will find a new place to live.
Two is a round number.
The round part is made to look new.
This is only the first round.
He is man of the year.
Show me where all the new people work.
You made me take his place.
After that we can go to my place.
That is the new part.
Which part did you make?
I may be down but not out.
Many people have been here.
The people will come back in the new year.
How can I get the people on my side?
She has been by his side every day.
That is now the bad side.
Any new work will take place here.
We made a place for you.
He made her look at the new thing.
You may have to take it back.
The show will go on.
Where did you find work?
There may be no way to find it now.
Get down from there.
Use the little round one.
The new man is here.
These people made me take it back.
I can see the other side now.
Can you find the man who made it?
Work with me on this.
That is part of who he is.
I take part in this every day.
Every part of it has been made here.
You may see her now.
Look me up if you find work.
I came to show you every little part.
Back then time was the only thing we had.
Time has been on my side.
This one is more round than the other.
It made only a little sound.
If you find it you can take it.
He was only a little man but he made the place live every day.
After you have been down there you will see it.
Your people made this place.
I like this new place that we have made.
I live for the day I can take this place back.
That is the only round part.
You have to use a new word in each round.
Some are more round than that.
We made this new work to round out the day.
Where did the round thing go?
The man came every year.
You can only take a little.
He may be little but he is so bad.
Can you find any down side?
Did any people make it back?
Do you have any water?
It can take a little time to get it back.
Take your time and live more than a little.
Take any part you would like.
Is there any more work to do?
You can go down any time.
Get back to me any time.
You will go to work every day.
Part time work may be all you can get.
That was only the first part.
You did your part when you could.
Did you find any part of him?
You made only a little part of it.
Use every part as if you made it.
I can find my place here.
There is no place like this.
This place may have been new but now it is not.
Place it back in the water.
Every little thing here is new.
The man said that only the new one will get work.
When the man came to live here he said that he had been down so long that it could only look up to him.
We can show it every day but no one will like it.
There are people down by the water.
This place has been made for him.
You could live here if you would take a little time to find some work.
That may be the man.
What can you tell me about the people that live here?
That man has been back every year.
Where have you been?
This is only the first time I have been back?
You may take the little round one.
You came after me.
You can take this only after the show is over.
One after the other.
They made this place after they made that one.
She came back after she had been down there.
Some of these people have been in this place for more than a year.
I came to live here only a day after you.
Did you go back to that little place where we first made it work?

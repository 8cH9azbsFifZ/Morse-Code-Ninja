The girl is plain enough.
He will give you the usual line.
The main group is ready.
Was I ever that young?
I just like the feel of wood.
It is the one with the red dog above the door.
You will have the list as soon as it is ready.
I feel as though I can talk to you.
The bird will go with me.
The sea is a large body of water.
Are you sure that dog will go home with this family?
Do not cut the song.
Measure out enough for three.
We will eat in the main room.
He came out of the wood.
Can you make it out of wood?
What kind of wood is that?
Make like a tree and leave.
This old wood is too hard.
That was her main point.
You dont care enough.
It was plain to see.
The girl was with her mother.
I would not like to be young again.
That is the ready light.
Does he think he is above that?
Will you ever feel good enough?
Stop on the red.
He is not on the press list.
I will leave even though I know I dont have to.
I feel that she is very near.
I can walk and talk at the same time.
That is the song of the red mountain bird.
It is too soon to tell.
She has a large body of work.
My family has a new dog.
That man will direct you.
Will she show you up?
You can never leave.
You can use a song to tell the story.
What is the measure of a man?
You must measure it again.
Will he measure up?
Take it one measure at a time.
This wood is just not sound.
That was the main part of the work.
When will enough be enough?
The cause was plain to see.
Do not call me a girl.
Just use the usual color.
We need some young men.
Are you ready to go?
It came from above.
Where will I ever get one?
Put the red one over here.
That will make for a long list.
I do not like the feel of it.
Just say what you feel.
It does not feel round.
I can not feel my face.
I can feel the rain on my hand.
Do not talk down to me.
That is the same bird I saw.
I thought it was too soon.
He was sound in body.
I would not do that to a dog.
That was the family home.
Do not plant it in direct sun.
I think that will go very well with this.
I must take leave of this place.
He got it for a song.
I use a watch to measure time.
Just build it out of wood.
The main line will go through here.
You have said enough.
We will have to cross this plain.
It is the story of a girl and her dog.
That is the usual way to go.
That young horse can sure run.
This is the ready room.
Put your hand above your head.
Do not ever come back.
It was round and red.
I feel as though I could walk a mile.
Does the bird talk like that all the time?
It is too soon to move the body.
Just let the dog follow you home.
That bird is in the same family.
Can you direct me to her room?
It does not always come down.
I was just about to leave.
That is a very old song.
How do you measure that?
Go cut me some wood.
That was the main thing.
There is not enough to cover all four of them.
It was as plain as day.
Follow the girl in white.
You may begin as usual.
You are never too old to feel young.
You must be ready to go at any time.
He could not get above it.
I will be here should you ever need me.
Watch his face turn red.
Make me a list of what you need.
Name that bird.
Talk to your father.
You may go if you feel you are ready.
It will be plain soon enough.
There was a second body.
That story will dog me all my life.
What is a man if he has no family?
It was direct and to the point.
What will go with this?
I said I would never leave you.
That is the number one song.

All I have is a five pound note.
Are you certain?
Can you correct this for me?
Come over to the dark side.
Cry me a river.
Did you make a note of that?
Do not correct me.
Do not cry out.
Dont cry for me.
Fly me to the small port.
Get the lead out.
Give it more power.
Give this note to your father.
Go cut the rest of the field.
He can machine it for you.
He had a voice like some kind of animal.
He had to machine a new part.
He has put on a pound or two since the last time I saw him.
He has the power to do it all.
He is just fine.
He is the lead figure in the field.
He was certain it was a sure thing.
Help me plan this out.
Her voice has real power.
How can you be certain?
I am as able as he is.
I am certain the fine will be small.
I am not a machine.
I can cover the rest of the star field.
I can not figure this out.
I did not notice it at all.
I got no notice.
I got this dog from the pound.
I had no voice in it.
I had to power the machine down.
I have the power.
I heard a cry from over there.
I love it when a plan is good.
I notice a certain fall in the power of your voice.
I notice your note does not have a noun.
I plan to give notice.
I plan to wait before I cry in the dark.
I plan to wait until the end.
I saw a star fall.
I saw a note about the fine machine you have in your town.
I was not able to rest at all.
I will own this town.
I will take a pound of those.
I will wait for you in town.
I will not fall.
It is a long way to fall.
It is a money machine.
It was a certain kind of fly.
It was a dark time.
It was too dark to see.
It will be a small light in the dark.
It will wait.
Just a short note.
Just go on and pound it in.
Just wait here.
Just wait until you hear this.
Let it fly.
Let me field that question.
Let me get a box for that.
Let me know what the rest want from us.
Let your voice sing.
Men do not cry.
Move on to the next machine.
My unit will lead.
No plan can cover it all.
One fine day.
Put this unit in the correct box.
Put up a star for her.
She is more than able.
She is the star of the show.
Does she get my note?
Did she figure out why they are in the lead?
She was the dark horse.
Show me how good your voice is.
That field is ready to be cut.
That figure is way too high.
That is his field.
That is just an old box of fish.
That is not a pound of lead.
That is not the kind of notice you want to get.
That is the rest of the story.
That star did not figure in my plan.
That thing will never fly.
That was a fine piece of work
That would be just fine with me.
The horse is in that field over there.
The notice said to wait.
The plan would not be complete.
The wait has been too long.
The water has too much lead.
They have been lead here.
This bird does not fly.
This is my home town.
This is the field unit.
This rest stop is not on the map.
This town is a make you town.
Use the correct form of the noun.
Wait for the sun to go down.
Wait until dark.
Wait until fall before you cut that.
We are all in the dark about it.
We may fall out over this.
Are they in the field?
Well fine then.
What is the unit of measure?
What is your power?
What unit is that?
Where is the notice?
Which field did you cross?
Who will lead the unit?
Why not take the rest of them?
You can follow or lead.
You can only fly so high.
You can play left field.
You go to town.
You had better leave town.
You may box it up now.
You may plan all you like.
You must lead on.
You must make certain of it.
You need to put a noun in your sentence.
You will just have to wait.
Your fly is open.

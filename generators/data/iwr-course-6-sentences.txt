I think that may help to give him a good name.
Give as good as you get.
Our people had a very good time.
It is under my name.
She has very good form.
So much of what he has to say is of little help.
I think that is great.
How low do you think he will go?
I have been through this before.
Do not give me that line.
You have to give before you can get.
Do not turn down good work.
This is a great cause.
Do you mean this is the same one?
We differ as to the cause.
Move on down the line.
The boy was right about this.
Is he the right man?
I do not think much of him.
Just go on through.
How low can you go?
You can not get much more low than that.
The help line is just through there.
He has a good name.
Our cause is just.
I do not think it will do much good.
Do you mean what you say?
I will give you my name if you think it will help.
I have to use the long form.
Just move on through.
I think that was a great day.
Just think how much good you will do.
It is a good thing.
You are the same mean man you were before.
Just think it through before you give that much.
The boy was a great help.
You could call the help line.
Give me good cause.
Form a line.
Move to the right.
When will i get my turn?
Say it like you mean it.
The time is right.
I think that is the right name.
Write your name on the line.
That was a very low move.
Move it to the right.
You can not take back that move.
Help me move this thing.
Say what you think.
Show him your good side.
Every move you make.
He was good help.
You can not turn here.
That is not very much help.
Our day will come.
We will do our thing.
I think the same way.
Think it through before you go.
His form is very bad.
His people give our side a bad name.
Can you show cause?
Good people may differ.
Turn it to the right.
Turn back before the people see you.
It was under the water.
That was just mean.
How much do you think you can get?
Just name it.
Just think what could have been.
She can get it from the same place I did.
That was not the right move.
Go on through to the other side.
He was just there.
If any man can show just cause you can.
When will it be low water?
I did not get a low number.
He made the same low move.
He will give you much to think about.
I just do not think that much of him.
We had a great time.
He is the same mean man he was before.
Can you get through to the other side?
That was a great line.
Get in line before the time is up.
If you think it will help.
Turn it down.
I mean to live a long time.
Turn the sound down low.
Turn it over and look at the other side.
Just as you say.
You can tell just from the look of it.
Move on through.
What name did you give your boy?
It is your turn to move.
Every move you make.
I can see right through you.
You and I are very much the same.
That would be a good line to take.
How great it is.
Much of what we think is just as good.
Just so long as you say as much to her.
Do it before you think about it.
If you mean the same thing just say it.
Good form will make you a great man.

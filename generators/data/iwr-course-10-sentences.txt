That was the last door between you and me.
A city that with only one tree is hard to live in.
Life has been hard since I had to cross the sea.
You might start your story there.
You saw how far she had to go after she left.
Draw out the story some more.
I never run late.
Dont start that with me.
You should press that right now.
Do not let him get real close.
This is the last time I will be late.
There is a tree between us.
I will build a city by the sea.
Where do you want to put the door?
She will have to cross the water first.
I have been here since you left.
How hard can it be?
Start off small and then let it grow.
How much might he take?
That is my story.
She saw the sea for the first time.
That is too far to run.
Let me draw him out.
I just dont know.
You can start while I go get more men.
Dont press me.
That was way too close.
You go left while I go right.
When will this get real for you?
My home life is great.
Go through the last door on the left.
Do not come between a man and his mother.
I like the city more than the country.
He is up in the tree stand.
Most of them cross through here.
It has been a long time since then.
That was a hard story to tell.
You need to start off with a good move.
He said I might have to go.
She saw her picture before she left.
Put that saw down.
Just how far do you think you will get?
Should we go by sea or by air?
It is never too late.
Dont let it run down.
It may be a while before I get there.
The press is too close.
Tell me if might will make it right.
That was the first real look we had.
They say that water is life.
He let his father stand between them.
He will be last in line.
There is the door.
When will the light go down in the city?
What kind of tree is that?
She will run cross country.
How have you been since I went home?
This will be a hard land to cross.
We must all start at the same time.
Just ask what might have been.
The story is far too long.
Can you saw that tree down for me?
That is what you call a sea change.
Draw near and I will tell you a story.
He left right before you did.
She was only a little late.
The house was very run down.
Dont try and make a run for it.
He had to press down hard before he could close it.
That was the right thing to say.
That is how it is in real life.
Do not let that animal through the door.
This might be the start of a big story.
He found the city too big.
This city is too small for the two of us.
You might as well take it.
Time to close that door.
What form will your story take?
It was round and hard.
We have had no light since the sun went down.
If you study hard you might just learn a thing or two.
Tell me a new story.
She can run as far as you can.
He saw the turn and went for it.
What he saw would make you run.
The sea made no sound.
Do not let him draw you in.
He left it right where he said he would.
His late father was a good man.
I know that you dont want it.
Play a little while I study.
The press were all over it.
He has been real close for a long time.
He found that life was a great thing to have.
If you find the answer you should keep it between us.
He left his old self at the door.
This is the last picture they have of her.
Here is the door.
This is a very old city.
I saw it down by that tree.
He was just too cross to let it go.
I have been down since I was three.
A hard man is good to find.
The only way to start is to start.
All might not be well.
Is it story time?
She saw her own name up there.
She has come so far.
The sea was hot.
That day is too far off.
I left it up that draw.
It is too late to ask him now.
He does not run this port.
It dont mean a thing.
Go change while I find it.
Dont press so hard.

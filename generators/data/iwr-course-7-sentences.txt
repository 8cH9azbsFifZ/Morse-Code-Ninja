Put the small end in here.
Is this too old?
I want to play all three.
Where does this sentence end?
Add these three to the large set.
How well does he play?
This one is also too small.
In the end he had to go home.
Can you read this sentence?
Hand him the large one.
This is the port side.
Where does the large one go?
I put a spell on you.
Add my name at the end.
Three is not an even number.
He did not land well.
You must play to the end.
We want a very big show.
Old people like to play too.
This sentence does not end well.
Three of these make a set.
I want your name and number.
You can get water from the well.
I also want to play.
A small thing may play a large part.
We must end this.
You could if you would put in the time.
His other home is not as big.
Read every word of it.
You can hand it over to me.
The old port was much more like home.
A large part of that is bad.
I can spell the word but not say it.
He can not even add three and three.
This land is your land.
Every thing must go.
This is too big.
He went over the port side.
That will be our first port of call.
Make an old thing new.
Put an end to this.
We want to take part as well.
We were all set to go.
I want to end it all.
There are three more over there.
This is too small time.
You can also use the long form.
I think his sentence was too long.
She can also play the small one.
I did not like the end.
We will not put up with this.
Show me what you have in your hand.
I have not been home for more than a year.
I just read that.
Hand it over.
Would you get me the large one?
Can you spell this for me?
It will all add up if you take the time to think about it.
It will even out in the end.
Tell me how to land this thing.
Every word must be just right.
That was very big of you.
Use up the old one first.
It was too hot for him.
What does it all mean?
Just write a new sentence.
I set it down just over there.
There were three of them before.
Who could want that?
It all went well.
Play it through to the end.
You could also say he went home.
Call the first play.
It was no small thing.
You can end this if you want.
Put it back.
I had to home in on it.
Mean it when you read it.
On the other hand.
I think he had too much port.
I could not find a large one.
Just set here a spell.
He had to add even more.
There was all the land you could want.
You must be very bad to do that.
Go big or go home.
Can you do what he does?
She is too old to do that.
The first set went too long.
I want you to find three more.
We will see how well you can do.
He has also been through it all.
Would you play that through one more time?
It was a very small sound.
This will make an end of it.
You put too much water in it.
I write home every day.
You will have to read this every day.
Get him to hand it to you.
Get a large one for me.
Spell each word in the sentence.
If you add one and two you get three.
I would not do it even if I could.
I came to this land with very little.
The show must go on.
That is one great big thing.

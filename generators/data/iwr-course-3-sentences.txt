They were all hot at some time.
They were all hot when she said what she did.
Some of them were here when you said she did it.
We can not all get as many as he did.
Which of them were out there?
They were all with the other one.
If it were all up to you, we would not be here.
Some were here but some were out there.
You use up all of your time if you write them.
When will I get to write out what she said?
It is all up to you.
Use it all up.
Which word can she use to tell it?
He said he would not use that word each time.
She had an out but she did not use it.
Each of them had an out but many of them did not use it.
Which one will you use?
How will you tell them their time is up?
Your time and his were all that you had.
I will write it if you tell me that she said it.
There is a way that I will get out of here.
If that many said they like it then we will use it.
Then how did it all get out?
Tell them it was not time for all that.
Write me if you can use it all.
Which of them said it?
Each of them said that they were here.
Which of them said that they were here?
For all we know they were all up there.
Some like it hot.
You can get some but I can not.
We were all there with you.
Which of them were hot?
You will use each word if you can.
Then the other one will get it.
He said that she said you were up there with her.
Some of them said you would use that word.
They were all out there when she said what he did.
Each of them know what you said.
If you use that word then you are bad.
How bad can you get?
It is time for you to get up there.
You can write to me if you like.
You can write to me when you have the time.
Write to me when you get the time.
Write it if you have some time.
Many of them do not have the time to write.
If you can get it then you will have all you can use.
If that is the way then you will get there.
If the other did not get it then you will.
That is the one to use when the other is not here.
Some of them will use the other one.
Which of them said that word?
Each of them said the other had it.
Some said he is up there with the bad one.
When we use them all up we will have to get some more.
I was there when he said that they were all out of them.
If you can use it then I will have to get one for you.
If that one is out then we will have to use the other one.
It was time for me to get out but he had some more time.
I will but you will not.
We were all in the hot one but he was in the other one.
Some of them would like to get it but he did not.
When were you all up there?
I said that it was time to use each word.
Many of them will write the bad word.
He was out there with some that were bad.
We are out of time.
When can you get up here?
Can I have a hot one?
I can not tell by what she said.
There were more of them.
Where can I use that word?
Which of you will have the time to get her?
They will use some of their time to get her.
It is about time.
They have each had their time.
It was a hot time.
They will not get their way this time.
He said a bad word.
That is the way many of them will write about it.
We can get there some other way.
This way out.
When your time is up you have to tell what you know.
If he had his way he would tell you all what to do.
I was with her when she said she would.
He would tell each of them.
Which of them will be the one to get it.
When will you get up?
Not a word was said about it.
I did not like it at all.
I do not like it that way.
That was the way she said it.
What word did she use?
They will have their way.
She had it up to here.
It was up there.
It will have to be said.
How was your time up there?
How did you use that word?
How did you use your time?
Did you use all of your time?
How did each of them get that many?
If she said I had to get it then I will.
How did you know that each of them had the time to do it?
Which of them was his?
Get on up there.
He will be here by then.
We were all here when she said it.
We were all out there when he did it.
It will be a hot time.
Which of them said it?
Can you tell me how to get up there?
How did he get way up there?
Which of them will know about it?
I had many of them.
What time is it?
You will use up all your time if you do that.
If you like it then you will have it.
He had it all.
You know some of them.
There is a way to get them.
We are all out of the other one.
Do not use that word.
That is one way to do it.
That can be said of them.
You can tell me some other time.
When will all of you get out of here?
When will you get them out of here?
Some of them were up there when she said she had to use a word which many of them did not like at all.
I know you did it but I can not tell her.
That is the way it is.
If you use up all your time then get some more.
Each word she said was a way to get out of some other hot time.
He was hot and did use a word that some will tell you is bad.

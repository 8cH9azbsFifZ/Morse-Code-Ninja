I dont care if you put your feet up in the car.
It took all of the second group to carry it.
My friend and I will eat in the room.
I was up on the mountain when it began to rain.
I had no idea there were fish in this river.
You should go north once you get to the base of the mountain.
The color went out of his face.
Just watch that horse with the white mark.
If you stop here you can hear music.
What color is the watch face?
Just a second.
Let me take the car.
He has two left feet.
What do I care?
Find the group that took my friend.
Carry this food to the room but do not eat it.
I do not eat fish.
That is where my friend began to walk up the mountain.
I began to get the idea.
The base is just north of the city.
You only live once.
I think they call it a water horse.
I cut my hand.
You have got to be sure.
I will take first watch.
That is a great color on you.
I will go to the north country.
I just have to face it.
Change to the other car.
Get on your feet.
I do not care.
I just saw the sea for the second time.
Follow the second group.
You could carry it.
I thought you took it.
I got in the house before the rain began.
I do not have room to eat any more.
They say she will make a great friend.
I do not even like the idea of fish.
I have a mountain of those.
Just head north.
For once in your life.
How do you write four in base two?
Draw near and hear me.
You will need a new horse.
It was just a small cut.
How can you be so sure?
I like to watch.
White is every color put together.
He has the same mean face.
Where did you put the car?
Keep your eye on his feet.
She is under my care.
He has not left my side for a second.
Do not group them together.
Make a thing to carry it in.
I hear he took it north.
Do not let the rain get you down.
The idea began to eat at me.
It is in the white room.
I like to fish with a friend.
Go on down the mountain.
It is just north of here.
You must try it once.
It is near the base of that tree.
What did you hear?
Will that horse run a mile?
Cut off the end.
Are you sure you saw what I saw?
Watch what you say.
This will put a little color in your face.
Come and watch my friend run.
This old car will need more care.
His feet will not carry him.
Do what her group does.
That might just carry the day.
She took the hard way.
That was a hard rain.
I live to eat.
There is room to grow.
I think I made a friend.
He began to walk north once he saw the horse at the base of the mountain.
That is the right idea.
That was a very bad idea.
I need some more fish food.
I had a home once.
He took second base.
Hear me out.
Get off that horse.
Time to cut and run.
I thought it was a sure thing.
I could watch them come and go all day.
I want to change the color.
He has a very round face.
You will just have to face it.
Take that last car and put it over there.
There is just three feet between them.
If you think about it you might begin to care.
It is on the second page of the book.
Was it a large group?
He will carry you over the mountain.
She took my picture.
What time will the rain stop?
Do people eat this?
Go get a room.
The horse began to run before my friend could get near it.
Are you open to the idea?
He took the fish home.
If you go up the mountain you will just have to come down again.
Stop this at once.
North is not up.
That base is not too large.
I want to hear the answer.
She was a very small horse.
He was about to cut me.
I sure think so.
Which of them will watch the white one.
He went up the north face.
She will color it by hand.

There were less than ten this morning.
It is a simple rule.
There are several I can not govern.
That vowel has more than one sound.
It went against them toward the end of the war.
Lay it out in a pattern with love at the center.
That is where the slow money will go.
Any person may serve science.
This road does not appear on the map.
It is too cold to pull that kind of thing.
I am not a morning person.
I will put one against any two of them.
It was a simple enough pattern.
I will not love you less if you have no money.
It was about ten this morning.
Move toward the center.
He is too simple for me.
I can carry several of them.
How many of them start with a vowel?
You will have to move it toward the road.
Make love not war.
I would lay even money on that.
He may rule against us.
This will serve as a pattern.
Pull over while I read the map.
I need some money for the road.
This person may appear to be cold.
The people will govern.
There is less of a pattern than I thought.
It is too cold at this hour of the morning.
Pull the next ten.
Do I appear simple to you?
There were several hundred.
Does the word end in a vowel?
Turn toward the west.
This is the end of war as we know it.
Lay them out as usual.
Why are you against it?
It was not a pattern to follow.
We need to slow that animal down.
The center will not hold.
Not for love or money.
He is a person of interest.
Do not serve that fish.
That would appear to be the end of it.
The road is a mile from the river.
The map is plain enough.
He is a man of science.
I thought you knew the rule.
Do not rule those men.
This rule should govern us all.
Pull it out now.
It all went cold.
Do not ask for less.
How has your morning been?
He can eat as much as ten men.
It is all so simple.
There are several more you can have.
Here is a word with more than one vowel.
Point it toward the back.
It will be a very short war.
Can I lay down?
He put it against the tree.
He found a new pattern.
Is that slow enough for you?
Cut to the center.
She was his great love.
You can tell what kind of person he is.
I do not have any paper money.
That was a bad serve.
He will never appear.
You must take the old road.
It did not look so big on the map.
I work in food science.
Where is the rule book?
Does he govern well?
We must all pull together.
Go down by the fire if you are cold.
It was a cold day.
He had to pull up short.
Dont rule it out.
I dont have my science book.
Map out each move.
That road is less direct.
It may appear at any time.
After that will they serve you?
Let us talk money.
That kind of thing can change a person.
I love wood.
Stop in the center.
Show me how slow you can go.
Just follow the pattern
Are all of you against me?
Go lay down by the fire.
He was in the great war.
He will run toward the south.
He had one of several old fish.
What could be more simple?
The most you can have is ten.
I will take a walk in the morning.
That is less of a problem than I thought it would be.
The road will go on and on.
